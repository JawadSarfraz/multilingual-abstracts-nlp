# Subject Prediction with STW Filtering

This project focuses on running a subject prediction model using a filtered dataset based on the **STW (Standard Thesaurus for Economics)** subject taxonomy. The process includes preparing the dataset, filtering out irrelevant subjects, and experimenting with prompt-based and model-based approaches for subject classification.
