      "Effective liner shipping is important for the global seaborne trade. The volume of cargoes transported by liner shipping has been increasing over the past decades. Liner shipping companies face three levels of decision problems, including strategic, tactical, and operational problems. The tactical-level decisions are commonly made every three to 6 months. These decisions include: (1) port service frequency determination; (2) fleet deployment; (3) sailing speed optimization; and (4) vessel schedule design. Most of the concurrent liner shipping studies have addressed the tactical-level decision problems separately. Even though a few studies have proposed joint planning models that capture multiple decision problems at the same time, none of the conducted studies has integrated all the four tactical-level decision problems. To address this gap in the state-of-the-art, this study presents a holistic optimization model that addresses all the tactical-level liner shipping decision problems, aiming to maximize the total profit obtained from liner shipping services. The key route service cost components, found in the liner shipping literature, are considered in this study, which include: (1) vessel operational cost; (2) vessel chartering cost; (3) port handling cost; (4) port late arrival cost; (5) fuel consumption cost; (6) container inventory costs in sea and at ports of call; and (7) emission costs in sea and at ports of call. An exact optimization approach is adopted for the developed mathematical model. The computational experiments, conducted for a set of Asia-North America liner shipping routes, showcase the efficiency of the proposed approach and offer some important managerial insights."

The logical answer to the question is yes, if the propensity of moving from low income state to high income state is high enough. The main contribution of this paper is to derive an analytical expression of income equality improving elasticity. It specifies the limit, after which replacement rate cut is equality enhancing measured by Gini coefficient."

      "Dem globalen Verbreitungstrend folgend werden klimapolitische Emissionshandelssysteme seit dem Jahr 2005 auch in Japan getestet. Die ökologischen und ökonomischen Erfolge sind allerdings bescheiden geblieben. Welche Ausgestaltungsmerkmale haben zu den Defiziten in den etablierten Systemen geführt und wie können sie modifiziert werden, um zukünftig ein klimapolitisch wirksames und gesamtgesellschaftlich kostengünstiges nationales Emissions-handelssystem zu implementieren? Zur Beantwortung diese Frage orientiert sich der Beitrag im Wesentlichen an praxisorientierten Design- und allokationstheoretischen Wirkungsanaly-sen. So kann gezeigt werden, dass für die Implementierung eines ökologisch effektiven und ökonomisch effizienten Emissionshandelssystems in Japan auf der Basis der bereits etablier-ten Infrastruktur vor allem Handlungsbedarf im Bereich der Verbindlichkeit der Teilnahme, der Zielfestlegung sowie der Erstvergabe und der Gültigkeit der Lizenzen besteht."

      "Within the German welfare system, heating expenditures of recipients are in general fully covered by the government. This paper empirically tests for the hypothesis that households receiving welfare payments turn to over consumption of residential space heating. We use microdata from two different data sources to explore whether conditional heating expenditures of these households significantly differ from those of other households. Our empirical findings suggest that even when controlling for a range of other factors this is indeed the case as heating expenditures lie about 10 percent above those of other households. These results are fairly robust to sensitivity analyses. Our results imply that there is potential scope for cost savings if this policy is changed."

      "We use data from a unique survey of members of drug-trafficking gangs in favelas (slums) of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to characterize drug-trafficking jobs and study the selection into gangs, analyzing what distinguishes gang-members from other youth living in favelas. We also estimate wage regressions for gang-members and examine their career path: age at entry, progression within the gangs' hierarchy, and short- to medium-term outcomes. Individuals from lower socioeconomic background and with no religious affiliation have higher probability of joining a gang, while those with problems at school and early use of drugs join the gang at younger ages. Wages within the gang do not depend on education, but are increasing with experience and involvement in gang-related violence. The two-year mortality rate in the sample of gang-members reaches 20%, with the probability of death increasing with initial involvement in gang violence and with personality traits associated with unruliness."

      "In this work we develop a set of labour market and fiscal policy experiments upon the labour and credit augmented \"Schumpeter meeting Keynes\" agent-based model. The labour market is declined under two institutional variants, the \"Fordist\" and the \"Competitive\" set- ups meant to capture the historical transition from the Fordist toward the post \"Thatcher- Reagan\" period. Inside these two regimes, we study the different effects of supply-side active labour market policies (ALMPs) vs. demand-management passive labour market ones (PLMPs). In particular, we analyse the effects of ALMPs aimed at promoting job search, and at providing training to unemployed people. Next, we compare the effects of these policies with unemployment benefits simply meant to sustain income and therefore aggregate demand. Considering the burden of unemployment benefits in terms of public budget, we link such provision with the objectives of the European Stability and Growth Pact. Our results show that (i) an appropriate level of skills is not enough to sustain growth when workers face adverse labour demand; (ii) supply-side policies are not able to reverse the perverse interaction between exibility and austerity; (iii) PLMPs outperform ALMPs in reducing unemployment and workers' skills deterioration; and (iv) demand-management policies are better suited to mitigate inequality and to improve and sustain long-run growth."

      "The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of regional images of Italy on the purchase probability of wine. Instead of regarding country image as a homogeneous national construct, this article focuses on revealing regional differences in Italian country image and investigating whether they are related with purchase probability. Moreover, several scholars state, that the development of larger regional brands can improve consumer choice especially for the product wine. In the light of growing global competition from 'New World' wine countries and simultaneously decreasing competitivity of the main European wine-producing countries (including Italy), the possibility to actively shape the development of regional brands and thereby potentially strengthening the competitive advantage within the European Union and on a global level, seems to offer an adequate approach to maintain the leading role of Italian wine producers in European and international trade. Therefore, this study aims to test, whether using larger regions (and not specific wine regions) as origin information for wine is applicable and improving consumer choice. The empirical framework was tested on a random sample of consumers living in Germany and comprises (a) the description of image differences between Northern and Southern Italy, (b) measuring the influence of regional indication of origin on purchase probability, (c) determining the predictive value of image components for purchase probability, and (d) the investigation of moderation effects of country knowledge on the results. Data from 388 respondents were analysed using multiple linear regression and paired t test. Results show significant image differences, which affects purchase probability. It is shown that the image of Southern Italy does not provide respondents with a suitable decision-making heuristic for buying wine. Furthermore, country knowledge negatively influences the predictive value of the measured regional image for purchase probability. As the predictive value of Southern Italian image does not contribute to the explanation of purchase probability, the present work corroborates the hypothesis of region-specific tendencies in the relationship between regional Italian image and consumer behaviour. Thus, this work provides a fundamental understanding of the regional composition of the Italian country image. It therefore serves practitioners as a decisional basis for the utilization of origin-related product information."

      "In this experimental study, we compare the influence of risk communication in the form of stories versus statistics on the level of investment in a resilience-promoting activity. We also analyze how this influence interacts with time gap and with an individual's preferences for risk and numbers. The results indicate that individuals invest more in a resilience-promoting activity when communication comes as a story. This finding holds irrespective of an individual's risk preference. The results did not confirm the expectation that communication in story form leads to a more enduring effect than communication in statistical form. The expectation that the preference for numbers influences the effectiveness of a specific communication form was also not confirmed."

      "This paper analyses data from a large-scale field experiment where unemployed workers were randomly assigned to an additional caseworker meeting with the purpose to impose a broader job search strategy. We find that the meeting significantly increases job finding and is cost effective. However, caseworkers differ substantially in the rate at which they impose broader job search. We exploit this heterogeneity in caseworker stringency and the random assignment of unemployed workers to caseworkers within local offices to evaluate the broader search requirement. Our results show that imposing the broader search requirements reduces job finding. We argue that restricting the job search opportunities forces unemployed workers to search sub-optimally which negatively affects labor market outcomes."

      "The effect of bank heterogeneity on the transmission of monetary policy is capturing an increasing attention, and the debate on how bank specific characteristics may determine their reaction to monetary actions is mounting. This paper participates in this flow of research by studying the reaction of 40 banks operating in Lebanon between 1994 and 2017, to a change in lending interest rate, taking into consideration: size, market power, capitalisation, credit risk, and liquidity. The empirical results show that the impact of a change in interest rate on loan supply depends on bank market power and bank liquidity only. Consequently, interest rate channel in Lebanon operates through banks with high market power and banks with high liquidity stocks."

      "Das Aufstellungsverfahren eines Regionalen Raumordnungsprogramms ist in Niedersachsen ein durch das Raumordnungsgesetz und das Niedersächsische Gesetz über Raumordnung und Landesplanung formal geregelter Prozess. Während sich in der Vergangenheit fast ausschließlich eine Vielzahl von Trägern öffentlicher Belange, Verbände und Vereinigungen mit öffentlichen Belangen in den Aufstellungsprozess eines Regionalen Raumordnungsprogramms eingebracht haben, ist bei der Festlegung von Eignungsgebieten/Vorranggebieten für die Windenergienutzung festzustellen, dass sich vermehrt die Öffentlichkeit beteiligt. Hier sind es auf der einen Seite die Grundstückseigentümer und Projektentwickler, die sich mit Anträgen auf Flächenausweisungen in das Verfahren einbringen und auf hohe Einnahmen durch die Windenergienutzung infolge der für sie günstigen regionalplanerischen Festlegungen spekulieren. Auf der anderen Seite steht der überschaubaren Zahl von Begünstigten eine große Zahl von Bürgern gegenüber, die ohne finanziellen Ausgleich aus ihrer Sicht die negativen Auswirkungen der Windenergienutzung vor Augen haben und sich mit einer ablehnenden Haltung bezüglich der Windenergienutzung in das Verfahren einbringen. Angesichts des infolge der Energiewende notwendigen Ausbaus erneuerbarer Energien werden zunehmend große Bevölkerungsteile, insbesondere durch die Windenergienutzung, betroffen sein. Es besteht daher dringender Handlungsbedarf hinsichtlich der Verteilung von Lasten und Gewinnen durch die Windenergienutzung.",
      "The preparatory process of a regional development plan in lower saxony is a formally regulated procedure. Whilst in the past the participants involved in the preparatory process of the regional development plan were almost exclusively representatives of public interests (local authorities and departments, nature conservation and other associations, public utilities etc.), it has been noticed that by the determination of suitability areas and priority areas for wind power land use, the general public in general have, of late, become increasingly involved. On the one side this is due to the number of landowners and project developers who are speculating on the high revenues achievable through wind energy utilization in areas determined through a favourable regional development plan. On the other side there are clearly a large number of citizens who will not derive any financial gain by the establishment of suitable areas for wind energy utilization and whose opinion it is that these areas have substantial negative repercussions. It is these participants who bring a dismissive attitude into the preparatory process. The expansion of alternative energy resources and in particular wind power will reach an ever increasing proportion of the community. It is therefore important to recognize that there is an urgent need for action regarding the distribution of gains and losses produced through the development of wind energy exploitation."

      "With 2.7 billion people relying on woodfuels for cooking in developing countries, the dissemination of improved cooking stoves (ICS) is frequently considered an effective instrument to combat deforestation particularly in arid countries. This paper evaluates the impacts of an ICS dissemination project in urban Senegal on charcoal consumption using data collected among 624 households. The virtue of our data is that it allows for rigorously estimating charcoal savings by accounting for both household characteristics and meal-specific cooking patterns. We find average savings of 25 percent per dish. In total, the intervention reduces the Senegalese charcoal consumption by around 1 percent."

      "In most euro area countries, the monetary/fiscal policy mix is responsible for the changing history of debt and inflation facts. Using a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model with Markov-switching policy rules, we identify three distinct monetary/fiscal regimes in France and Italy: a Passive Monetary-Active Fiscal regime (PM/AF) before the late 80s/early 90s; an Active Monetary-Passive Fiscal regime (AM/PF) with central bank independence and EMU convergence; a third regime with policy rates at the effective lower bound combined with fiscal active behaviour to sustain the recovery. Our simulations reveal that the PM/AF regime in France led to price volatility and debt stabilisation, while the AM/PF regime resulted in disinflation and rising debt trajectory. Meanwhile, Italy's procyclical fiscal policy in downturns contributed to persisting imbalances, high aggregate volatility, and low growth."

      "In 1956, Solow proposed a neoclassical growth model in opposition or as an alternative to Keynesian growth models. The Solow model of economic growth provided foundations for models embedded in the new theory of economic growth, known as the theory of endogenous growth, such as the renowned growth models developed by Paul M. Romer and Robert E. Lucas in the 1980s and 90s. The augmentations of the Solow model described in this book, excepting the Phelps golden rules of capital accumulation and the Mankiw-Romer-Weil and Nonneman-Vanhoudt models, were developed by the authors over the last two decades. The book identifies six spheres of interest in modern macroeconomic theory: the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on growth; the effect of different returns to scale on production; the influence of mobility of factors of production among different countries on their development; the effect of population dynamics on growth; the periodicity of investment rates and their influence on growth; and the effect of exogenous shocks in the form of an epidemic. For each of these issues, the authors construct and analyze an appropriate growth model that focuses on the description of the specific macroeconomic problem. This book not only continues the neoclassical tradition of thought in economics focused on quantitative economic change but also, and to a significant extent, discusses alternative approaches to certain questions of economic growth, utilizing conclusions that can be drawn from the Solow model. It is a useful tool in analyzing contemporary issues related to growth."

      "The paper discusses the conditions under which new markets are created, and tries to identify them by an empirical case study of Japan's silver market. It starts from the perspective that the source of competitive advantage under fundamental uncertainty lies in the integration of objective and subjective opportunities that derive from economic, socio-political, and cognitive conditions. The authors argue that the promise of the eventual size of the silver market is insufficient as an explanation for market creation because of the uncertainties involved. Moreover, cultural traditions are much more varied than stereotypes may suggest and explain rather little. The supply and diffusion of information by various state organs, business associations and firms is conspicuous. The role of the state is a helpful one, though 'hard' regulation is less important than elsewhere. The emerging market can profit from well-established core competences like manufacturing expertise and from the contribution of well-established, large enterprises and wide inter-firm networks. The authors conclude that Japanese firms do not have an inbuilt inability to create novelty as is sometimes suggested, particularly in cases where established enterprises can utilise their peculiar resource endowment. The plasticity of available institutions and technologies should not be underestimated, and a helpful mechanism to overcome cognitive path dependencies is soft regulation."

      "In this paper, we use data from the National Household Survey (PNAD) for Brazil to investigate the dynamics of the urban wage premium and the relationship between the urban wage premium and inequality trends, and we find two main results. First, we find a decreasing urban wage premium over the period 2002-2009 using both OLS and quantile regression. Second, we show that the fall in the urban wage premium is more pronounced at the 90th percentile than at the 10th percentile. This finding suggests that the falling urban wage premium has contributed to the reduction in inequality observed in Brazil in the last decade."

      "Der Forschungsbereich 4 \"Konjunktur, Arbeitszeit und Arbeitsmarkt\" des IAB analysiert die kurzfristige Entwicklung des Arbeitsmarktes auf der Makroebene. Ein verfolgter Ansatz ist die Einbettung des Arbeitsmarktgeschehens in ein gesamtwirtschaftliches, interdependentes Konjunkturmodell. Damit können die Auswirkungen der konjunkturellen Entwicklung sowie politischer Maßnahmen auf den Arbeitsmarkt im gesamtwirtschaftlichen Kontext dargestellt, simuliert und prognostiziert werden. In Kooperation des IAB mit dem RWI Essen entstand unter dieser Zielvorgabe eine Arbeitsmarktversion des RWI-Konjunkturmodells. Sie enthält zusätzliche Module: Eines beschreibt den Arbeitsmarkt detaillierter, gliedert ihn z.B. in den ersten und zweiten Arbeitsmarkt und disaggregiert wichtige Variablen, wie z.B. die Zahl der Erwerbstätigen nach Sektoren, Ost und West, nach der Stellung im Beruf und nach der Qualifikation. Ein zweites Modul integriert wichtige Zusammenhänge und Ergebnisse der Arbeitszeitrechnung des IAB. Schließlich berücksichtigt ein drittes Modul explizit die Einnahmen und Ausgaben der Bundesagentur für Arbeit. Neben der Erläuterung und Prüfung der Einzelgleichungen stellt der Bericht in der Betrachtung des Gesamtmodells fest, dass es die Entwicklung auf dem Arbeitsmarkt in der Vergangenheit gut erklärt und langfristig stabil ist. Anhand von Alternativrechnungen wird aufgezeigt, wie Änderungen volkswirtschaftlicher Rahmendaten auf kurze Sicht insbesondere das Wirtschaftswachstum, die Beschäftigungsentwicklung und Arbeitslosigkeit beeinflussen. Mit einer Simulation gesamtwirtschaftlicher Wirkungen von Arbeitsbeschaffungs- und Strukturanpassungsmaßnahmen enthält der Bericht auch ein Beispiel für die Anwendung des Modells in der Evaluationsforschung und in der Politikberatung."

      "We analyze collateralized loan obligation (CLO) transactions by European banks (1997 - 2004), trying to identify firm-specific and macroeconomic factors influencing an institution's securitization decision. CLO issuance seems to be an appropriate funding tool for large banks with high risk and low liquidity. However, risk transfer turns out to be limited in the extremes. Controlling for fixed effects, we find that fixed costs of securitization are surmountable also for smaller institutions. Interestingly, commercial banks seem to use loan securitization to access capital-market based businesses and the associated fee income. Regulatory capital arbitrage does not appear to have driven the market.",
      "Trotz des rasanten Wachstums des Marktes für Kreditrisikotransfer sind die Motive der Banken für die Verbriefung von Kreditportfolios noch nicht vollständig geklärt. Kreditverbriefungen führen zwar zu höherer Liquidität, einer Reduktion von Kredit- und Zinsrisiken, einer Steigerung von Provisionseinkommen, möglicherweise auch einer Verbesserung der Kapitalstruktur, jedoch entscheiden sich einige Banken trotzdem gegen eine Strukturierung und Weiterreichung ihrer Kreditportfolios. Unter den Nachteilen der Verbriefung werden unter anderem die relativ hohen fixen Kosten der erstmaligen Errichtung einer Verbriefungsstruktur sowie eventuelle Steuernachteile von nicht auf der Bilanz gehaltenen Krediten genannt. Weiterhin ermöglicht das neue Basel-II Regelwerk keine ?Arbitrage regulatorischen Eigenkapitals? via Kreditverbriefung mehr, anders als die weniger risikosensitive Eigenkapitalunterlegung unter den alten Basel-Richtlinien. Unsere Studie analysiert ?Collateralized Loan Obligation? (CLO) Transaktionen von Europäischen Banken in den Jahren 1997-2004. Ziel ist es, Faktoren zu isolieren, die die Entscheidung einer Bank, Kredite zu verbriefen, beeinflusst haben. Während wir einen Einfluss regulatorischer Arbitrage nicht vollkommen ausschließen können, zeigt unsere Studie, dass die wesentlichen Bestimmungsfaktoren vielmehr individuelle Faktoren der Banken sind. So ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass eine Bank Kredite verbrieft, umso höher, je größer die Bank, je geringer ihre Liquidität und je höher ihr erwartetes Kreditrisiko ist. Kreditverbriefungen werden offensichtlich als Möglichkeit des Kreditrisikotransfers genutzt. Allerdings zeigt sich, dass Banken mit dem höchsten Kreditrisiko ihre Verbriefungsaktivitäten mit zunehmendem Risiko einstellen, so dass die Risikotransferfunktion nur begrenzt zu nutzen zu sein scheint. Für am Aktienmarkt notierte Banken treffen obige Aussagen noch stärker zu. Interessanterweise zeigt sich hier sogar ein ?negativer? regulatorischer Arbitrageeffekt : Banken mit niedrigem regulatorischem Eigenkapital verbriefen weniger Kredite als Banken mit höherem Eigenkapital. Die neuen Eigenkapitalrichtlinien nach Basel II sollten daher das zukünftige Wachstum des Kreditrisikotransfermarktes nicht beeinträchtigen. Bemerkenswerterweise scheint auch die Bankengröße eine weniger wichtige Rolle zu spielen als zunächst gedacht. Auch kleinere Banken sind somit in der Lage, die mit einer Kreditverbriefung verbundenen Fixkosten zu tragen. Es ist zu vermuten, dass gerade traditionelle Kreditbanken die Verbriefung von Kreditportfolios unter anderem auch nutzen, um indirekt dem ?investment-banking? verwandte Geschäftsbereiche und die entsprechenden Provisionseinkommen zu erschließen."

      "This study examines the contingency and threshold effects of economic freedom in the economic globalisation (EG) and inclusive green growth (IGG) relationship in Africa. Based on macro data for 22 African countries and the Driscoll-Kraay standard errors with fixed effects instrumental variable regression, the following findings are established. First, Africa's mostly unfree economic setting, conditions EG to reduce IGG. Second, when we disaggregate EG into its financial and trade globalisation components, we find that the IGG-impeding net effect of the latter is rather striking. Third evidence from our threshold analysis suggests that by improving Africa's mostly unfree economic architecture to 60% (moderately free) or 80% (free), the IGG-deteriorating net effects of EG are mitigated (but not nullified). We conclude that unless effort is made to improve Africa's economic architecture level, the envisaged IGG gains of economic globalisation might prove elusive."

      "Gemäß der klassischen ökonomischen Theorie der Kriminalität sollte ein Anstieg der erwarteten Strafe (also des Produktes aus Strafwahrscheinlichkeit und Strafmaß) eine Reduktion der Kriminalität bewirken. In der empirischen Analyse gestaltet sich ein Test dieser überschaubar anmutenden Hypothese als äußerst komplex. 'Kriminalität' gliedert sich in eine Vielzahl von Deliktgruppen und die Operationalisierung von 'Strafwahrscheinlichkeit' durchläuft im rechtsstaatlichen System die Handlungen und Entscheidungen der Institutionen 'Polizei', 'Staatsanwaltschaft' und 'Gericht' und variiert in den Zahlen zu Aufklärungs-, Anklage- und Verurteilungsquoten sowie in Entscheidungen über Geld-, Haft- und Bewährungs- oder Jugendstrafen. Üblicherweise wird in der empirischen Kriminalitätsforschung nur ein Bruchteil dieser Zusammenhänge gleichzeitig berücksichtigt. Den Autoren der Studie ist es gelungen, dieses Defizit zu überwinden und eine entsprechend umfassende, mit Bundesländerdaten des Zeitraums 1977 - 2001 der Polizeilichen Kriminalstatistik und der Strafverfolgungsstatistik aufgebaute Datenbank (RegKrimDA) zu erstellen. In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden die Daten und ihre Nutzbarkeit anhand deskriptiver Beschreibungen und einer panelökonometrischen Untersuchung der Wirkung des deutschen Strafverfolgungssystems auf das Kriminalitätsaufkommen in sechs wichtigen Deliktgruppen vorgestellt. Die Ergebnisse liefern deutliche Anzeichen für die Wirksamkeit von Abschreckung. Als wichtigster kriminalitätsreduzierender Faktor erweist sich die Verurteilungswahrscheinlichkeit von Tatverdächtigen. Eine konsequentere Verurteilung von prinzipiell anklagefähigen Tatverdächtigen, deren Ermittlungsverfahren in den letzten Jahren immer häufiger von den Staatsanwaltschaften eingestellt werden, könnte daher - entgegen der Auffassung weiter Teile der deutschen Kriminologie - sinnvoll sein. In einem Forschungsausblick wird aufgezeigt, wie die Datenbank unter Nutzung entsprechender Methoden und Erweiterungen im Rahmen von Kosten- Nutzen-Analysen der deutschen Kriminalpolitik eingesetzt werden könnte."

In addition to the phenom- enon of cream skimming emphasized in earlier literature, we here point to the the importance of the opposite: dregs skimming, whereby high-risk consumers are proÞtably detracted from the candidate pooling contract."

      "The increasing use of the Internet creates a need to manage traffic while preserving equal treatment of content. We estimate demand for residential broadband, using high-frequency data from subscribers facing a three-part tariff, and use the estimates to study the welfare implications of usage-based pricing, a commonly offered solution to network congestion. The three-part tariff makes data usage during the billing cycle a dynamic problem; thus, generating variation in the (shadow) price of usage during the month. We provide evidence that subscribers respond to this variation, and use their dynamic decisions to estimate a flexible distribution of willingness to pay for different plan characteristics. Using these estimates, we show that usage-based pricing eliminates low-value traffic and improves overall welfare. Usage-based pricing might decrease consumer surplus, depending on what alternative is considered. Furthermore, we show that the costs associated with investment in fiber-optic networks (an alternative proposed to deal with congestion) are likely recoverable in some markets."

      "This paper studies the impact of access to electricity via solar-powered home systems (SHSs) in rural communities in Peru. Applying propensity score matching at the community as well as at the household level, the authors find that households with SHSs spend less on traditional sources of energy---candles and batteries for flashlights---and that the subsequent savings are commensurate to the fee for SHS use. People in households with SHSs spend more time awake, and women in particular change patterns of time use: they spend more time taking care of children, cooking, doing laundry, and weaving for their families, and less time in productive activities outside their homes (farming). Children spend more time doing homework, which has translated into more years of schooling (among elementary school students) and higher rates of enrollment (in secondary school). Although women spend less time farming and men more time on home business activities in households with SHSs than in those without, these changes have had no evident impact on income or poverty."

      "In the context of persisting sustainability challenges in the Global Cocoa-Chocolate Chain (GCCC), sustainability certification gained momentum as a major industry response. While much research has been undertaking regarding effects of certification schemes on farming practices and farmers' livelihoods, there is little understanding of how these private sector responses transform the local economy. Taking the case of sustainability certification in the cocoa industry of Ghana, this study provides an empirical insight in effects of the rapid proliferation of sustainability certification on the local marketing environment and new forms of competition among local market players. Applying a lens of Global Value Chain theory, the study offers a discussion on upgrading opportunities for local companies and their responses to certification-linked pressures. In the Ghanaian cocoa sector, t sustainability certification became a key tool of competition for farmers among local buying companies. Yet, due to the lack of pre-financing capacities for the costly implementation of certification schemes, and the lack of off-taking arrangements, local Licensed Buying Companies (LBCs) are structurally disadvantaged with the implementation of certification schemes compared to their transnational counterparts and therefore face a strong tendency of losing market shares. The paper contributes to the study of sustainability in the GCCC in two ways: 1) It provides insights on the functioning of the so far understudied local marketing segment and changing dynamics of competition and governance, and 2) it enlarges the sustainability debate by including structural transformations of the industry linked to the implementation of certification."

      "Purpose: Blockchain technology (BCT) is argued to deliver a trustless system where trust is driven by technology rather than individuals or organizations. This paper studies this claim using insights related to tracing sustainability features in the metal industry. Methodology: The results of this study are based on multiple case studies of two supply chains (steel and copper) piloting a traceability solution for tracing metal sustainability throughout the supply chain. The data are collected and analyzed from multiple actors using sources such as interviews and secondary documents. Findings: The study empirically supported that even if the BCT is applied, there will be a need for: benevolence, integrity, ability, and credibility dimensions of trust. Hence, a trustless system is still not yet applicable. Moreover, to remove the need for the trusted third party certificates, there are boundary conditions such as governance structures and standardizations that must be addressed first. Originality: The concept of trust in the novel phenomena of the BCT was investigated from different point of views, such as the supplier and the buyer views. Moreover, different contexts were examined such as the commercial and the sustainability contexts. Therefore, this paper is among the first to handle the issue of trust from these regards."

      "This paper explores how different levels of knowledge correlate with desirable preventive and curative practices against malaria in Honduras. The paper additionally analyzes 'information externalities' associated with non-specific malaria health services, communicational campaigns and organized community networks. Using the 2004 ENSEMAH survey, the analysis tests for statistical differences in the means of behavioral variables and an index of household malaria knowledge, finding that the adoption of desirable prevention and treatment behaviors correlates with proficient levels of knowledge. Differences in behavior across groups with distinctive levels of proficiency were found statistically significant. Also, while information externalities exist, they nonetheless do not deliver adequate levels of knowledge proficiency to induce desirable anti-malaria behavior."

      "Through a VECM, during 1961-2017 in Argentina, we found cointegration between the Multilateral Real Exchange Rate and four fundamental variables: Net Foreign Assets, Public Expenditure, Terms of Trade, and Productivity. Defining the Real Exchange Rate as domestic prices in dollars, we estimate a positive relationship with its fundamentals except for the Terms of Trade. The model anticipates the large devaluations that occurred in 1975 (Rodrigazo), 1981 (Martínez de Hoz), 2002 (end of the Convertibility) and 2015 (end of the \"cepo cambiario\"). The speed of adjustment is 30% per year. Finally, during 2012-2017 the model estimates an average misalignment (real appreciation) of 15% per year."

Results show that mid-career teachers with better pre-service qualifications are the most eager to search, different types of teachers and schools have different search strategies, and the market is turbulent, characterized by search friction and large movements of teachers to better, worse, or comparable schools. The market is not as stable and orderly as it may first appear. Simulations show that simple policies to direct teacher transfers are at best inefficient."

      "Foreign aid and international development frequently bring with it a range of unintended consequences, both negative and positive. This book delves into these consequences, providing a fresh and comprehensive guide to understanding and addressing them. The book starts by laying out a theoretical framework based on complexity thinking, before going on to explore the ten most prevalent kinds of unintended effects of foreign aid: backlash effects, conflict effects, migration and resettlement effects, price effects, marginalization effects, behavioural effects, negative spillover effects, governance effects, environmental effects, and ripple effects. Each chapter revolves around a set of concrete case studies, analysing the mechanisms underpinning the unintended effects and proposing ways in which policymakers, practitioners, and evaluators can tackle negative side effects and maximize positive side effects. The book also includes personal testimonies, a succinct overview of unintended effects, and suggestions for further reading. Providing a clear overview of what side effects to anticipate when planning, executing, and evaluating aid, this book will be an important resource for students, development practitioners, and policymakers alike."

With inelastic demand, a fine (time-varying) reward is equivalent to a fine toll, and to a continuum of combinations of time-varying tolls and rewards (including fine feebates). When demand is price sensitive, a reward becomes less attractive from the efficiency viewpoint, because it attracts additional users to the congested bottleneck. As a result, both the second-best optimal rate of participation in the scheme, and the relative efficiency that can be achieved with it, decreases when demand becomes more elastic. Our analytical and simulation results for coarse schemes suggest that a coarse reward is less effective than a coarse feebate, which is itself less effective than a coarse toll. The most efficient coarse system is the step toll, which is also allowed to be positive in the shoulder period."

      "This study examines the effect of GDP per capita on the Gini index, which measures income concentration, in Colombia. The methodology used is an econometric analysis of time series with data extracted from the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank. The econometric results suggest that, at least during the period studied here, there is no evidence that GDP per capita has been an explanatory variable of the behaviour of income distribution in Colombia. The results also align with the understanding that the problem of inequality in the distribution of income is not merely economic but concerns persistent matters such as political and historical issues."

      "We investigate the transmission of central bank liquidity to bank deposits and loan spreads in Europe over the period from January 2006 to June 2010. We find evidence consistent with an impaired transmission channel due to bank risk. Central bank liquidity does not translate into lower loan spreads for high-risk banks for maturities beyond one year, even as it lowers deposit spreads for both high-risk and low-risk banks. This adversely affects the balance sheets of highrisk bank borrowers, leading to lower payouts, capital expenditures and employment. Overall, our results suggest that banks' capital constraints at the time of an easing of monetary policy pose a challenge to the effectiveness of the bank-lending channel and the central bank's lender-of- last-resort function."

      "We distinguish and assess three fundamental views of the labor market regarding the movements in unemployment: (i) the frictionless equilibrium view; (ii) the chain reaction theory, or prolonged adjustment view; and (iii) the hysteresis view. While the frictionless view implies a clear compartmentalization between the short and long run, the hysteresis view implies that all the short-run fluctuations automatically turn into long-run changes in the unemployment rate. We assert the problems faced by these conceptions in explaining the diversity of labor market experiences across the OECD labor markets. We argue that the prolonged adjustment view can overcome these problems since it implies that the short, medium, and long runs are interrelated, merging with one another along an intertemporal continuum."

      "To attract greater levels of foreign direct investment into their gold mining sectors, many mineral-rich countries in sub-Saharan Africa have been willing to overlook serious instances of mining company non-compliance with environmental standards. These lapses in regulatory oversight and enforcement have led to high levels of pollution in many mining communities. The likelihood is high that the risk of pollution-related sicknesses, such as skin infections, upper and lower respiratory disorders, and cardiovascular diseases, will necessitate increasingly high healthcare expenditures in affected communities. In this study, we propose and estimate a hedonic-type model that relates healthcare expenditure to the degree of residents' exposure to mining pollution using data obtained on gold mining in Ghana. The empirical results confirm that, after controlling for factors such as current and long-term health status, increased mining pollution leads to higher healthcare expenditure."

      "The fifth Factor X publication from the Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA), The Impossibilities of the Circular Economy provides an overview of the limits to the circular economy, emphasising the relationship between integrated resource use and more systemic leadership-management approaches. On a European level, the book ties into the recent European Green Deal and aims to empower actors across sectors and EU member countries to transition from existing linear models of value capture and expression to more systemic-circular solutions of value capture and expression. The volume provides a hands-on contribution towards building the knowledge and skill sets of current and future decision-makers who face these complex-systemic crises in their day-to-day business. The book further provides access to best practices from cutting-edge research and development findings, which will empower decision-makers to develop a more sustainable and equitable economy. Providing solutions for a more sustainable economy, this book is essential reading for scholars and students of natural resource use, sustainable business, environmental economics and sustainable development, as well as decision-makers and experts from the fields of policy development, industry and civil society."

Governments routinely exempt the rich from taxation on grounds of their charitable expenditure. We examine the normative logic of this exemption. We show that, rather than reducing it, philanthropy may aggravate absolute inequality in welfare achievement, while leaving the change in relative inequality ambiguous. Additionally, philanthropic preferences may increase the effectiveness of policies to redistribute income, instead of weakening them. Consequently, the general normative case for exempting the wealthy from expropriation, on grounds of their public goods contributions, appears dubious."

      "The presidential elections of 25 April 2015 resulted in a victory for the incumbent, Faure Gnassingbé. Thus, he secured his third five-year term, consolidating the autocratic grip of the Gnassingbé-clan and his followers, who had been in power since 1967. In view of the absolute majority of the ruling party, its inclination for meaningful constitutional and electoral reforms that would have been required for free and fair elections was further reduced. The reforms were postponed open-endedly. Overriding concerns for stability in West Africa in view of growing Islamist threats in neighbouring countries as well as Togo’s role as troop contributor made that the delayed democratic reforms including the time and again reported local elections were condoned by the donor community. However, simmering discontent of the hardliners among the security forces and the barons of the ruling party was still visible. The opposition tried in vain to overcome its divide between its moderate and radical wing. An alliance of opposition parties and civic groups opposed the regime peacefully by frequent, often violently suppressed demonstrations with little effect. Human rights records of the government improved but remained tarnished. The tense political climate persisted in view of the presidential elections in April 2015 and the apparent determination of the President to stay in power a third and eventually even a fourth term whatever the cost. Despite undeniable improvements of the framework and outside appearance of major institutions of the regime during the survey period it remained a façade democracy. However, the international community, notably African peers, the AU and ECOWAS, but also the Bretton-Woods Institutions, China and the EU, followed a ‘laissez faire’ approach in the interest of stability and their proper national interest in dealings with the country. Economic growth remained stable at about 5% p.a. Public investment in infrastructure (roads, harbour) and increases in agricultural productivity, notably of export crop production, had been the key drivers of growth. But growth remained sensitive to external shocks and the vagaries of the climate and was not inclusive. It was overshadowed by increasing inter-personal and regional inequality as well as an upturn in extreme poverty. Moreover, money laundering and illegal money transfers grow to alarming proportions. The latter amounted to 1.9 bio. US $ p.a. from 2002 to 2011 whereby it greatly surpassed the national budget. Concerning the relation of illegal financial transfers to GDP Togo was leading worldwide with 76.3% (2008 to 2013). The business climate improved considerably nevertheless. Although Togo still counted among low income fragile states according to the World Bank it aimed at advancing into the group of developing economies. Yet, in view of its vulnerability concerning political crisis and social unrest this was a quite ambitious aim.",
      "RÉSUMÉ: Les élections présidentielles du 25 avril 2015 ont abouti à une victoire pour le titulaire, Faure Gnassingbé. Ainsi, il a obtenu son troisième mandat de cinq ans, consolidant l'emprise autocratique du Gnassingbé-clan et de ses partisans, qui étaient au pouvoir depuis 1967. Compte tenu de la majorité absolue du parti au pouvoir, son penchant pour des reformes constitutionnels et électoraux, des réformes qui auraient été nécessaires pour des élections libres et équitables ont été encore réduites. Les réformes ont été reportées encore une fois. La communauté des donateurs avait approuvée les réformes démocratiques retardées, y compris les élections locales, en vue des préoccupations primordiales pour la stabilité en Afrique de l'Ouest, en raison de la menace croissante des islamistes dans les pays voisins, ainsi que du rôle du Togo en tant que contributeur des troupes. Cependant, le mécontentement entre les forces de sécurité Togolais et les barons du parti au pouvoir était encore visible. L'opposition a essayé en vain de surmonter son fossé entre son aile modérée et radicale. Une alliance de partis d'opposition et de groupes civiques s'est opposée pacifiquement au régime par des manifestations fréquentes, souvent violemment supprimées, avec peu d'effet. Les dossiers des droits de l'homme du gouvernement se sont améliorés, mais sont restés ternes. Le climat politique tendu persistait en vue des élections présidentielles d'avril 2015 et la détermination apparente du Président à rester au pouvoir un troisième et finalement même un quatrième terme quel que soit le coût. Malgré des améliorations indéniables du cadre et de l'apparence extérieure des principales institutions du régime au cours de la période d'enquête, il restait une démocratie de façade. Cependant, la communauté internationale, notamment les pairs africains, l'UA et la CEDEAO, mais aussi les institutions de Bretton-Woods, la Chine et l'UE, ont suivi une approche «laissez-faire» dans l'intérêt de la stabilité et de leur intérêt national pour les relations avec le pays . La croissance économique est restée stable à environ 5% p.a. L'investissement public dans les infrastructures (routes, port) et l'augmentation de la productivité agricole, notamment de la production des cultures d'exportation, ont été les moteurs de la croissance. Mais la croissance est restée sensible aux chocs extérieurs et aux aléas du climat et n'est pas exhaustive. Il a été éclipsé par l'augmentation des inégalités interpersonnelles et régionales ainsi que par une reprise de l'extrême pauvreté. En outre, le blanchiment d'argent et les transferts illégaux d'argent augmentent à des proportions alarmantes. Ce dernier équivalait à 1,9 Mrd. US $ p.a. de 2002 à 2011, ce qui a largement dépassé le budget national. Concernant la relation des transferts financiers illégaux au PIB, Togo a été leader mondial avec 76,3% (2008 à 2013). Le climat des affaires s'est considérablement amélioré. Bien que le Togo compte encore parmi les États fragiles, à faible revenu, selon la Banque mondiale, il vise à progresser dans le groupe des économies en développement. Pourtant, compte tenu de sa vulnérabilité à l'égard de la crise politique et des troubles sociaux, c'était un objectif tout à fait ambitieux."

      "Most studies of intergenerational mobility focus on adjacent generations, and there is limited knowledge about multigenerational mobility that is, status transmission across three generations. We examine multigenerational educational and occupational mobility in India, using a nationally representative data-set the India Human Development Survey which contains information about education and occupation for three generations. We find that mobility has increased over generations for education, but not for occupation. We also find that there are stark differences across social groups, with individuals belonging to socially disadvantaged communities in India lagging behind in social progress. Multigenerational mobility for Muslims in education and occupation have decreased in comparison to Hindus over the three generations. While we find that there is an increase in educational mobility for other disadvantaged groups such as Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes compared to General Castes, we do not find evidence of increased occupational mobility over the three generations."

      "We consider a budget-constrained mechanism designer who selects an optimal set of projects to maximize her utility. A project's cost is private information and its value for the designer may vary. In this allocation problem, the selection of projects - both which and how many - is endogenously determined by the mechanism. The designer faces ex-post constraints: The participation and budget constraints must hold for each possible outcome while the mechanism must be implementable in dominant strategies. We derive the class of optimal mechanisms and show that it has a deferred acceptance auction representation. This feature guarantees an implementation with a descending clock auction. Only in the case of symmetric projects do price clocks descend synchronously such that the cheapest projects are executed. The case in which values or costs are asymmetrically distributed features a novel tradeoff between quantity and quality. Interestingly, this tradeoff mitigates the distortion due to the informational asymmetry compared to environments where quantity is exogenous."

      "We compare health system responses to the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and Spain. In both countries, healthcare is managed at the regional level, but the central government behaved differently in the uncertainty surrounding the first wave, leaving more autonomy to regional governments in Italy than in Spain. Upon documenting national and regional health system responses, we show evidence of a significant gap in the number of infected cases, alongside regular and emergency hospital admissions, and mortality in the two countries, both at the national and at the regional level. We then discuss several potential mechanisms, such as policy stringency, the localization of the pandemic and mobility restrictions, measurement error, and especially the regional autonomy, enjoyed by Italian regions but not by Spanish regional governments amidst a state of alarm in both countries. We find that, given the strong localized effect of the pandemic, allowing more autonomy, and fostering experimentation and local solutions explains the gap between Italy and Spain in the first wave of the pandemic."

As an initial sample, 150 owners/top managers from 150 SMEs (one informant from each) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, were chosen. A stratified random sample was employed for this cross-sectional study. Applying structural equation modeling, the combined influence of internal and external variables influencing the intention to adopt BT is explored. Results show that: (1) knowledge of artificial intelligence has a positive and significant effect on the adoption of blockchain technology; (2) the relevant advantage of artificial intelligence has a positive and significant effect on the adoption of blockchain technology; (3) perceived ease of use of artificial intelligence has a positive and significant effect on the adoption of blockchain technology; (4) risk-taking behavior mediates the relationship between knowledge of artificial intelligence and adoption of blockchain technology; (5) risk-taking behavior does not mediate the relationship between relevant advantage and perceived ease of use of artificial intelligence with the adoption of blockchain technology. The current study is one of the few empirical investigations relating to SMEs using artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies for business operations. The study's limitations are the small sample size and use of a single informant. However, the findings on the adoption of blockchain technology have applications for boosting the competitiveness of SMEs. This study's originality stems from two factors: the novelty of blockchain technology and its potential to upend SMEs' conventional mode of operation. It highlights the need to consider the key variables affecting SMEs' adoption of blockchain technology with artificial intelligence."

      "Fiscal welfare, i.e. the use of the tax system to achieve social policy goals, is assuming ever greater importance throughout Europe and beyond. In housing, the favourable tax treatment of mortgage interest repayments has often coexisted alongside public programmes of housing benefit or social housing. Although the distributional effects of tax expenditure are known to be regressive, the issue has remained relatively under-researched. The paper uses the European tax-benefit model EUROMOD to quantify the distributional impact of mortgage interest tax relief in five European countries: the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Italy and Greece. The analysis reveals that higher-income groups capture a disproportionate share of total expenditure on mortgage interest tax relief in all countries, and that this effect is most regressive in the Netherlands and least regressive in Sweden. The paper concludes with a discussion of results and their policy implications."

      "Cameroon is an example of a developing country where the transition from agriculture to services has defied standard patterns seen in developed countries. While prior research has explored this shift's impact on economic growth, its effects on women's representation in the labour market have been overlooked. This study addresses this gap by examining how changes in the tertiary sector affect women's employment. Decomposition analysis based on 461 Cameroonian firms indicates a 6.2 per cent feminization pattern over the past decade, primarily driven by increased female employment in wholesale and construction industries. This growth results from within-industry effects rather than reallocation effects, emphasizing the significance of internal industry factors over external influences like government policies or broader economic changes. Importantly, econometric estimations, adjusting for fixed effects, endogeneity, and selection biases, reveal that an inadequately trained workforce hinders further feminization. The paper concludes with recommendations for promoting gender equality in Cameroon and across Africa."

      "This paper attempts to assess three main issues on Peruvian telecommunications technology: what are the main variables that explain the demand for access to telephone services; how important is access to telephone services in explaining the transition out of poverty, and what are the consumption and welfare impacts of the significant increase in the supply of telephone lines since the divestiture in 1994 of the Peruvian telephone services. To accomplish our goal we will use two methodologies. Firstly, we will concentrate on residential telephony based on a countrywide representative consumer expenditure survey (The World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Survey). With this household survey the demand for access to telephone services was modeled and the effects of access to a telephone on poverty was analyzed. The main result showed that access to a telephone is important in explaining why low income households do not drop into poverty, but that it is not significant in explaining the transition between poor and non-poor status. Additionally, the presence of these surveys for 1985, 91, 94 and 1997, allowed us to estimate the welfare impacts at different socioeconomic levels of the various institutional changes in telephone services before and after privatization. The second methodology takes advantage of a panel of households for Metropolitan Lima allowing us to estimate partial demand equations of access to telephone services in order to evaluate consumers' welfare pre and post divestiture showing the presence of an important positive consumer surplus of access to a residential telephone. Both methodologies measured how welfare gains coming from more people having access to telephone lines might have compensated for higher usage rates as the result of privatization. The main objective of these methodologies is therefore to assess which types of households, classified according to their observable characteristics, bear a greater portion of the burden or enjoy most of the benefits of the changes brought about by privatization.",
      "Die vorliegende Studie beschäftigt sich mit drei Problemen, die im Zusammenhang mit Veränderungen auf dem Gebiet der peruanischen Telekommunikationsdienste stehen. Diese Probleme sind: erstens die Frage nach den wichtigsten Variablen, die die Nachfrage nach Telefondiensten bestimmen; zweitens, die Rolle des Zugangs zu Telekommunikationsdiensten in Abhängigkeit verschiedener Stadien materieller Armut; drittens stellt sich die Frage, inwieweit sich die – seit der Teilprivatisierung des Telekommunikationsmarktes im Jahre 1994 andauernde – stetige steigende Anzahl an Telefonanschlüssen auf Konsum- und Wohlfahrtskriterien auswirkt. Zur Untersuchung dieser Fragen werden zwei verschiedene Methoden angewendet. Zum einen werden Daten herangezogen, die im Rahmen einer repräsentativen und landesweiten Konsumentenbefragung erhoben wurden. Diese Daten erlauben auf der Haushaltsebene eine Modellierung der Nachfrage nach Telekommunikationsdiensten sowie des potentiellen Einflusses der Telefonnutzung auf materielle Armut. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass der Zugang zu Telefonen, insbesondere für Haushalte mit niedrigem Einkommen, wichtig ist, um ihren ökonomischen Status zu erhalten bzw. zu verbessern. Andererseits ergab sich aber kein signifikanter Zusammenhang zwischen der Nutzung der Dienste und der Überwindung von Armut. Datensätze aus den Jahren 1985, 1991, 1994 sowie 1997 wurden genutzt, um die Wohlfahrtseffekte, die die institutionellen Veränderungen auf dem Telekommunikationssektor mit sich brachten, auf verschiedenen sozioökonomischen Niveaus für den Zeitraum vor bzw. nach der Privatisierung des Sektors zu untersuchen. Schließlich konnten mit Hilfe von Erhebungen in Lima partielle Nachfragefunktionen vom Zugang zu Telekommunikationsdiensten vor und nach der Privatisierung geschätzt werden. Die so gewonnenen Erkenntnisse bezüglich der Konsumentenrenten lassen den Schluss zu, dass insbesondere die Nutzer von privaten Hausanschlüssen von den Veränderungen profitieren."

      "We employ a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to investigate the causal effect of China's Energy Conservation Law (ECL) on the energy efficiency of Chinese firms. Using data from the 2018 China Employer-Employee Survey (CEES), we find that the energy regulation has a positive impact on enterprise energy efficiency. Furthermore, we observe that the effects of the regulation vary across industries, ownership types, and firm ages. We also find that energy management system (EnMS) and technological innovation are mechanisms through which the energy regulation helps improve enterprise energy efficiency. These findings underscore the importance of well-designed and effectively implemented energy regulations in fostering energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions in the industrial sector. They also highlight the need to consider the heterogeneity of the regulatory impact when designing energy-saving policies."

      "Economists' principal explanations of the subprime crisis differ from those developed by noneconomists in that the latter see it as rooted in the US legacy of racial/ethnic inequality, and especially in racial residential segregation, whereas the former ignore race. This paper traces this disjuncture to two sources. What is missing in the social science view is any attention to the market mechanisms involved in subprime lending; and economists, on their side, have drawn too tight a boundary for the economic, focusing on market mechanisms per se, to the exclusion of the households and community whose resources and outcomes these mechanisms affect. Economists' extensive empirical studies of racial redlining and discrimination in credit markets have, ironically, had the effect of making race analytically invisible. Because of these explanatory lacunae, two defining aspects of the subprime crisis have not been well explained. First, why were borrowers that had previously been excluded from equal access to mortgage credit instead super included in subprime lending? Second, why didn't the flood of mortgage brokers that accompanied the 2000s housing boom educe the proportion of minority borrowers who were burdened with costly and ultimately unpayable mortgages? This paper develops a mesoanalysis to answer the first of these questions. This analysis traces the coevolution of banking strategies and client communities, shaped by and reinforcing patterns of racial/ethnic inequality. The second question is answered by showing how unequal power relations impacted patterns of subprime lending. Consequences for gender inequality in credit markets are also briefly discussed."

      "Forest decline and degradation are particularly high in the tropics and pose a risk to those who depend on forest resources. The in-migration of smallholders to forest frontiers can fuel transitions of livelihoods and land and resource use. However, the conditions under which in-migration contributes to such transitions remain poorly understood. With this study, we aim to investigate the influence of in-migration, together with other non-demographic factors, on the livelihoods of local and migrant communities. As a case study, we chose the Guraferda district, a hotspot of rural in-migration and forest loss in southwest Ethiopia, where the forest-based local population experienced a rapid transition to agriculture-based livelihoods. We used 224 household surveys in three different kebeles (smallest administrative unit in Ethiopia) and applied descriptive and analytical statistics to understand how and why the forest activities of local and migrant groups have changed since a major resettlement program was launched in 2003. The findings were contextualized by local expert knowledge to assess forest loss and the role of in-migration in livelihood transitions and deforestation. Forest cover in Guraferda declined partially because of the in-migration of smallholders from agricultural-based systems, and insecure land tenure, but also considerably because of the expansion of commercial agriculture. With the decline in forest, the local population adopted migrants’ agricultural practices, a trend further encouraged by agricultural policies and barriers to participation in forest management for locals. Our study challenges simplified assumptions in in-migration–deforestation debates by showing that governmental policies, land tenure, and natural-resource access are mediating the impact of migration on livelihood transitions and deforestation. We conclude that securing land tenure and equal access to natural resources for frontier residents and promoting a mix of agricultural and forest livelihood activities can reduce adverse impacts in in-migration areas."

      "Currency crises episodes of 1996, 1998, and 2001 are used to identify common country specific causes of currency crises in South Africa. The paper identifies crises by the use of an Exchange Market Pressure (EMP) index as introduced by Eichengreen, Rose and Wyplosz (1996). It extends the Signals Approach introduced by Kaminsky and Reinhart (1996, 1998) by developing a composite indicator in order to measure the evolution of currency crisis risk in South Africa. The analysis considers the standard suspects from international currency crises and country specifics as identified by the Myburgh Commission (2002) and current literature as potentially relevant indicators.",

Die Identifikation der Währungskrisen erfolgt mittels des Exchange Market Pressure Indexes, welcher von Eichengreen, Rose und Wyplosz (1996) entwickelt wurde. Dann wird ein Signalansatz, basierend auf Kaminsky und Reinhart (1996, 1998) verwendet, um mit dessen Hilfe das Risiko für Währungskrisen in Südafrika zu evaluieren. Die Arbeit berücksichtigt als potentielle Einflussgrößen die üblichen Variablen aus der Währungskrisentheorie sowie länderspezifische Faktoren, welche sich aus dem Bericht der Myburgh Commission (2002) und aktueller Literatur ergeben."

      "We study a seller's optimal mechanism for maximizing revenue when a buyer may present evidence relevant to her value. We show that a condition very close to transparency of buyer segments is necessary and sufficient for the optimal mechanism to be deterministic--hence akin to classic third degree price discrimination--independently of non-evidence characteristics. We also find another sufficient condition depending on both evidence and valuations, whose content is that evidence is hierarchical. When these conditions are violated, the optimal mechanism contains a mixture of second and third degree price discrimination, where the former is implemented via sale of lotteries. We interpret such randomization in terms of the probability of negotiation breakdown in a bargaining protocol whose sequential equilibrium implements the optimal mechanism."

      "The goal of this first report of the 'Benchmarking Employment Offices - Nordic and Other European Comparisons (acronym BEO) is an analytical comparison of the Danish, Finnish and Swedish labour market policy principles and structures primarily from a practical point of view. The purpose is to provide a background to compare, at a later stage, the recent reforms in the labour administrations in the Nordic countries (including later also Norway) with Germany and Holland. In reflecting on the Danish, Finnish and Swedish labour market policy and service reforms, we mainly use the Danish reform as a reference point, and then comment on the similarities and differences of Finland and Sweden in relation to it. It must be noted, however, that the Swedish observations are based on a preliminary study, and will be elaborated further as our work progresses.",

Damit soll eine Art 'Folie' für spätere Vergleiche der kürzlich durchgeführten Reformen in den Arbeitsverwaltungen der nordeuropäischen Ländern inkl. Norwegens mit denen in Deutschland und Holland geschaffen werden. Für die Analyse der dänischen, finnischen und schwedischen Arbeitsmarktpolitik und Reformen der Arbeitsverwaltung wird hauptsächlich die dänische Reform als Referenzrahmen verwendet. Unter Bezug darauf werden Ähnlichkeiten und Unterschiede für die Fälle Finnland und Schweden beschrieben und kommentiert. Für den Fall Schweden muß allerdings darauf hingewiesen werden, daß die Ergebnisse auf einer vorläufigen Studie beruhen und in einem späteren Arbeitsschritt weiter ausgearbeitet werden."

      "This paper investigates the design of incentives in a dynamic adverse selection framework when agents' production technologies display learning effects and agents' rate of learning is private knowledge. In a simple two-period model with full commitment available to the principal, we show that whether learning effects are over- or under-exploited crucially depends on whether learning effects increase or decrease the principal's uncertainty about agents' costs of production. Hence, what drives the over- or underexploitation of learning effects is whether more efficient agents also learn faster (so costs diverge through learning effects) or whether it is the less efficient agents who learn faster (so costs converge). Furthermore, we show that if divergence in costs through learning effects is strong enough, learning effects will not be exploited at all, in a sense to be made precise."

      "The competitive environment is leading companies in every industry to reinforce their focus on innovation-related activities, and especially on knowledge exploration and exploitation. The relevance of these concepts has generated an important literature as well as appropriate measurement scales. The scales proposed by Atuahene-Gima (2005) have been commonly taken as a reference. However, these have been applied more in medium or high-tech industries than in low-tech industries. In this sense, this study aims to validate the scales to measure knowledge exploration and exploitation capabilities in a low-tech industry as the textile industry. The results show that while it is feasible to use these scales in this type of industries, they need to be adjusted to suit their specificities."

      "The COVID-19 pandemic increased pressure on the relationship between governments and the public, making cooperation between both actors more critical than ever. Surprisingly, there is significant variation in public compliance with health policies, especially regarding vaccine uptake across different countries. Based on this finding, we seek to understand why vaccination hesitancy varies between countries. Instead of focusing solely on government trust and satisfaction, this research examines the impact of individuals' experiences having lived in autocratic countries on vaccine hesitancy. We derive a formal model of how autocratic experience and the subsequent distrust in health policies affect the individual calculus on vaccine uptake, and test the propositions of our model in a sample of 33 European countries on the micro-level. We find that autocratic experience gravely impacts individual vaccine hesitancy. Our findings shed light on the prolonged impact of autocratic rule on societal processes and on the roots of vaccine hesitancy, which is not rooted in general distrust but rather a highly specific form of scepticism towards government action."

      "This paper analyses the impact of the global economic crisis on unemployment and long term unemployment in the OECD. It uses simple econometric models using panel data (quarterly) and time series data. In general, we find that long term unemployment increases with the unemployment rate, there is persistence in long term unemployment, and that the employment protection variable and the replacement rate are statistically insignificant. Overall, the findings of our research are that there are many differences between the impact of the Great Recession on different countries. Countries that faced a significant financial crisis and a collapse of the housing market bubble have had large increases in unemployment and long term unemployment. There was a big fall in employment in the (especially) construction and manufacturing industries. The financial collapse led to an increase in unemployment in the financial and business sector. As a result of these twin shocks labour mobility of the unemployed is likely to be affected: with negative equity in housing, unemployed workers are unlikely to move regionally. With a loss of wealth (in housing and financial assets, including superannuation) there will be a fall in consumer spending which will slow down the recovery of economies. This means that, especially for some countries, there will be a long period of high unemployment and long term unemployment."

      "Incentivized experiments in which individuals receive monetary rewards according to the outcomes of their decisions are regarded as the gold standard for preference elicitation in experimental economics. These task-related real payments are considered necessary to reveal subjects' \"true preferences\". Using a systematic, large-sample approach with three subject pools of private investors, professional investors, and students, we test the effect of task-related monetary incentives on risk preferences in four standard experimental tasks. We find no systematic differences in behavior between and within subjects in the incentivized and non-incentivized regimes. We discuss implications for academic research and for applications in the field."

      "Dieses Arbeitspapier ist das Ergebnis eines ostasienwissenschaftlichen Seminars der Universität Duisburg zu den deutschen/europäischen außenpolitischen und außenwirtschaftspolitischen Beziehungen mit Japan, dessen Zielsetzung die Erstellung eines Gutachtens für das Auswärtige Amt war ('Task Force'). Von den Studierenden wurden in vier Arbeitsgruppen die Politikfelder 'Vereinte Nationen und Sicherheitspolitik', 'Entwicklungszusammenarbeit', 'Marktzugangsproblematik' und 'Außenwirtschafts-förderung' bearbeitet und, soweit aufgrund der vorliegenden Informationen möglich, konkrete Politikempfehlungen formuliert. Zentrale Politikempfehlungen sind: · ein stärkeres sicherheitspolitisches Engagement der EU in Ost- und Südostasien, · die Nutzung des identifizierten Potentials für bilaterale Initiativen in der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit, · die Verstetigung der Prozesse eines konsensuale Abbaus von Marktzugangshemmnissen durch eine institutionelle Fundierung. · eine stärkere Bündelung und Konzentration der Außenwirtschaftsförderungskompetenz und eine verstärkte Fokussierung auf die Ebene der Bewusstseinsbildung. Die Arbeit schließt eine chronologische Darstellung der deutsch-japanischen Beziehungen seit 1945 ein, die dem Interessierten auch über das Internet zugänglich ist (http://www.uniduisburg.de/FB5/VWL/OAWI/JAPAN/allgemein.html)."

      "Income distribution data from before the Industrial Revolution usually comes in the shape of social tables: inventories of a range of social groups and their mean incomes. These are frequently reported without adjusting for within-group income dispersion, leading to a systematic downward bias in the reporting of pre-industrial inequality. This paper suggests a correction method, and applies it to an existing collection of twenty-five social tables, from Rome in AD 1 to India in 1947. The corrections, using a variety of assumptions on within-group dispersion, lead to substantial increases in the Gini coeffcients. Combining the inequality levels with data on GDP, a robust positive relationship between income inequality and economic growth is confirmed. This supports earlier proposals, based on fewer data points, of a 'super Kuznets curve' of increasing inequality over the entire pre-industrial period."

      "Purpose: This paper aims to highlight resolution of Islamic finance dispute by common law-oriented courts in Nigeria with respect to Sharīʿah non-compliance and legal risks thereof, as well as the lesson to learn from Malaysia in that regard. This is with view to ensuring Sharīʿah compliance and legal safety of Islamic finance practice as prerequisites for sustainability of the Nigerian Islamic finance industry. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative method was used; interviews were conducted with different categories of experts and primary data collected in relation to Sharīʿah non-compliance and legal risks in adjudicating Islamic finance dispute by civil courts and the role of expert advice as basis for court referral to Financial Regulation Advisory Council of Experts. A doctrinal approach was adopted to analyse relevant legislative provisions and content analysis of secondary data relevant to applicable provisions in matters of finance before civil courts. Findings The paper discovers an indispensable role of conventional financial regulations in sustaining Islamic finance industry. Appropriate laws for Islamic finance under the conventional framework foster legal safety and Sharīʿah compliance of Islamic finance activities in related cases handled by courts. Nigeria civil courts can aid sustainability of Islamic finance when so equipped and enabled by laws that address apparent Sharīʿah non-compliance and legal risks in judicial dispute resolution. Inadequate legal provisions for dispute resolution breeds Sharīʿah non-compliance and legal risks in Islamic finance, undermine its prospects and stand inimical to its sustainability. Research limitations/implications This research is limited by its focus on Sharīʿah non-compliance and legal risks alone, which emanate mainly from judicial resolution of Islamic finance dispute by Nigerian civil courts. Practical implications This research seeks to motivate a determined and deliberate regulatory action and change in approach towards addressing apparent risks associated with Islamic finance while resolving disputes therein by civil courts. It has implications on common law jurisdictions generally that adopt similar approach as Nigeria's while introducing Islamic finance into their conventional finance framework. Originality/value Dispute resolution and other regulatory functions of civil courts are important to Islamic finance though apparently overlooked while introducing Islamic finance in Nigeria as in other emerging jurisdictions. This research ascertains the role of the civil courts as indispensable for Islamic Financial Institution (IFIs) operations and demonstrates that such courts are needed for the development and sustainability of Islamic finance industry. The research demonstrates the end-to-end requirement of Sharīʿah compliance of Islamic financial transactions as absolute and needs be ensured and guarded at dispute resolution level by properly equipped courts."

      "This paper investigates the macroeconomic and social determinants of voting behavior, and especially of political polarization, for 20 advanced countries using annual data ranging from 1970 to 2016 and covering 291 parliamentary elections. Using a panel estimation approach and rolling regressions we find empirical evidence supporting that a) traditionally established mainstream parties (center-left, center, and center-right) are penalized for poor economic performance; b) far-left (populist and radical parties) parties benefit from increasing unemployment rates; c) greater income inequality has increased the electoral support for far-right parties, particularly in recent times. Further, we do not find empirical support for the notion that social and economic globalization has led to an increase of popularity of far-right parties. These results have wide reaching implications for the current political situation in the Western world."

      "Die in diesem Band versammelten Beiträge überbrücken eine Zeitspanne von drei Jahrzehnten im wissenschaftlichen Wirken Walter Euckens, von seiner 1921 gehaltenen Antrittsvorlesung \"Zur Würdigung Saint Simons\" bis zum letzten von ihm verfassten Beitrag \"Unser Zeitalter der Misserfolge\", den er für seine Gastvorlesungen im März 1950 an der London School of Economics vorbereitetet hatte. Die fünfzehn hier wieder abgedruckten Beiträge sind über die dazwischen liegenden Jahre nicht nur recht ungleichmäßig verteilt, sie unterscheiden sich auch deutlich in ihrem Charakter. Elf von ihnen erschienen zwischen 1925 und 1932 in der Zeitschrift des - sich an der Philosophie von Rudolf Eucken, Walter Euckens Vater, ausrichtenden - Euckenbundes, die zunächst unter dem Namen Der Euckenbund, ab 1925 als Die Tatwelt erschien. Dem Charakter der Zeitschrift entsprechend, richteten sich diese Beiträge an ein allgemein gebildetes Publikum. Die übrigen vier richten sich an ein Fachpublikum, wie die beiden bereits genannten Beiträge, der 1932 erschienene Aufsatz \"Staatliche Strukturwandlungen und die Krise des Kapitalismus\", der gemeinhin als Gründungsdokument der Freiburger Schule gilt, und der 1948 in der Zeitschrift Economica veröffentlichte Aufsatz \"On the Theory of he Centrally Planned Economy\", der sich mit den planwirtschaftlichen Erfahrungen im Nationalsozialismus befasst. Das Thema, das die in diesen Band aufgenommenen Beiträge verbindet, ist die Wahrnehmung der Gegenwart als Krisenzeit und die Frage danach, worin die Ursachen der Krise zu sehen sind und auf welchem Wege ihre Lösung gefunden werden kann. Einen Schwerpunkt bildet dabei die Auseinandersetzung mit dem Anspruch des Sozialismus, einen solchen Weg aufzeigen zu können. Von Bedeutung für die Einordnung der Beiträge in Euckens Gesamtwerk ist der Umstand, dass sich in seiner Antwort auf die Frage der Krisenursache und Krisentherapie und in seiner Sozialismus-Kritik im Verlauf der 1920er Jahre eine charakteristische Akzentverschiebung zeigt. In dieser Einleitung wird es darum gehen, die Veränderung in Euckens Krisenanalyse aufzuzeigen und die Bedeutung deutlich zu machen, die ihr für die Herausbildung des von ihm maßgeblich initiierten ordoliberalen Forschungsprogramms zukommt."

      "While liberalization in energy markets has been a widely successful process all over the world, incumbents often still hold a dominant position. Thus, electricity wholesale markets are subject to market surveillance. Nevertheless, consolidated findings on abusive practices of market power and their cause and effect in wholesale electricity markets are scarce and non-controversial market monitoring practices fail to exist. Our application of the established measure of market concentration RSI shows that it serves as a decent indicator for the rents that can be gained in the market but also reveals considerable weaknesses of the RSI. Therefore, we propose and apply the \"Return on Withholding Capacity Index\" (RWC) representing a measure of the firms' incentive of withholding capacity as a complementary index to the RSI."

      "This paper uncovers an inverted U-shaped relationship between firm exit and total factor productivity (TFP) growth using Spanish data. At low levels of firm exit, Schumpeterian cleansing effects dominate and the effect of firm destruction on TFP is positive, but when exit rates are very high, this effect turns negative. In order to rationalize this finding, we build on Asturias et al. (Firm entry and exit and aggregate growth, Technical report, National Bureau of Economic Research, 2017) and develop a model of firm dynamics with exit spillovers calibrated to match the nonlinearity found in the data. This reduced-form spillover captures amplification effects from very high destruction rates that might force viable firms to exit, for example, due to disruptions in the production network and a generalized contraction in credit supply. Armed with the calibrated model, we perform counterfactual scenarios depending on the severity of the shock to firm's outcomes. We find that when the shock is mild and firm destruction rates at impact are similar to those observed during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), TFP growth increases, and the recovery is faster. However, when the shock is severe and firm exit is well above that of the GFC, TFP growth decreases, since high-efficiency firms are forced out of the market, which makes the recovery much slower."

      "Traditional assets, like stocks and bonds, are mostly found to be highly influenced by uncertainties, and cause distress for investors most of the time, consequently investors look for safe investment options that can provide diversification benefits to cope with uncertainties. So, current research unveils the diversification characteristics of real estate by investigating its relationship with a set of selected financial assets like KSE-100 index, gold, sub-asset classes; growth stocks, value stocks, large stocks, small stock, and sector's stock. Autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) approach is employed on monthly time series data for a time span of 2011 to 2019. Findings indicate that real estate behaves quite differently than all of these assets and holds good diversification potential for Pakistani investors because it exhibits no relationship with any of the assets under study. Findings suggest that Pakistani investors must incorporate real estate in their asset allocation strategy for diversifying their portfolios. Current research contributes to literature by unveiling the diversification potential of real estate in comparison to a set of financial variables that are rarely investigated in previous literature. Moreover, it contributes well to the knowledge of Pakistani investors and asset/investment managers to make healthy investment decisions."

      "In this paper we address the issue of the role of ideology and political preferences of publically engaged economists and contribute to the debate on consensus in economics. To do so, we conduct a social network analysis on the signatories of economist petitions, which we identify as one channel for economists to exert public influence. We base our analysis on 77 public policy petitions and presidential anti-/endorsement letters from 2008-2017 in the United States with more than 6,400 signatories and check the robustness of our results with six sub-networks. Our contribution is twofold: On the one hand we provide an extended empirical basis for the debate on consensus in economics and the role of politics and ideology in economics. On the other hand we provide a viable tool to trace the ideological leaning of (prospective) economist petitions and economists based on the social structure of petition networks."

      "This paper explores the optimal allocation of government bond purchases within a monetary union, using a two-region DSGE model, where regions are asymmetric with respect to economic size and portfolio characteristics: the extent of substitutability between assets of different maturity and origin, asset home bias, and steady-state levels of government debt. An optimal quantitative easing (QE) policy under commitment does not only reflect different region sizes but is also a function of these dimensions of portfolio heterogeneity. By calibrating the model to the euro area, we show that optimal QE favors purchases from the smaller region (Periphery instead of Core), given that the former faces stronger portfolio frictions. A fully optimal policy consisting of both the short-term interest rate and QE lifts the monetary union away from the zero lower bound faster than an optimal interest rate policy alone, which entails forward guidance."

      "Credit booms have globally fuelled hikes in stock, raw material and real estate markets which have culminated in the recent US subprime market crisis. We explain the global asset market booms since the mid 1980s based on the overinvestment theories of Hayek, Wicksell and Schumpeter. We argue that ample liquidity supply originating in the large industrialized countries has contributed to overinvestment cycles in Japan, East Asia, the new markets in the industrial countries and many emerging market economies. Expansionary monetary policies in response to the burst of bubbles are argued to have contributed to vagabonding bubbles around the globe."

      "The Russian banking sector has experienced enormous growth rates during the last 6-7 years. The rapid growth of assets has, however, contributed to a decrease in the capital adequacy ratio, thus influencing the ability of banks to cope with risk. Using quarterly data spanning from 1999 to 2007 on all Russian banks, we investigate the relationship between bank characteristics and risk-taking by Russian banks. The analysis of financial ratios reveals that, on average, the risk levels are still below those observed in Central and Eastern Europe. Combining the group-wise comparisons of financial ratios and the results of insolvency risk analysis based on fixed effects vector decomposition, three main conclusions emerge. First, controlling for bank characteristics, large banks have higher insolvency risk than small ones. Second, foreign-owned banks exhibit higher insolvency risk than domestic banks and large state-controlled banks are, unlike other state-controlled banks, more stable. Third, we find that the regional banks engage in significantly more risk-taking than their counterparts in Moscow."

      "Norway has abundant gas resources in the North Sea. The Norwegian gas production accounts for 2 percent of the world production and 17 percent of the European gas production. Despite huge gas production and resources, gas is not used for electricity generation in Norway. Excess capacity, cheap hydropower, low electricity prices and political restrictions have prevented gas based power generation in Norway. Lately, import of electric power from neighboring countries with fossil fuel based power systems has led industry spokesmen and various politicians to propose building of several gas power plants in Norway. Electric self-sufficiency, domestic natural gas utilization and environmental benefits through reduced coal power generation abroad are used as arguments to support construction of gas power plants in Norway. Several industrial groups have applied for concession to build natural gas fired power stations. Initially, the Norwegian Pollution Control Authority (SFT) denied emissions concession referring to Norwegian obligations under the Kyoto protocol. In March 2000, however, a majority in parliament voted against the SFT-decision and advised the Government to issue concession. The core argument from both sides was the environmental impacts from gas power generation in Norway. SFT argued that increased power generation would lead to lower energy prices and thereby higher energy consumption and more pollution. The view of the majority of Parliament was that Norwegian gas power will replace coal power generation in Denmark and Germany and thus give lower total climate gas emissions since coal based power results in much higher emissions per unit of energy than gas power does. The Nordic electricity system and market is very complex and therefore energy policy measures may result in numerous different impacts and repercussions. Therefore, we carry out a number of model simulations to analyze the impacts from introduction of Norwegian gas power generation into this market. We apply an equilibrium model for the Nordic electricity market. In order to describe important intra-year supply-side technology and fuel substitution, the Normod-T model has a detailed time-resolution. Our calculations show that none of the two views are completely right. The aggregate effect on climate emissions from producing gas power in Norway may be positive or negative, and depends heavily on the assumptions made.

      "Shock is a term of art that pervades modern economics appearing in nearly a quarter of all journal articles in economics and in nearly half in macroeconomics. Surprisingly, its rise as an essential element in the vocabulary of economists can be dated only to the early 1970s. The paper traces the history of shocks in macroeconomics from Frisch and Slutzky in the 1920s and 1930s through real-business-cycle and DSGE models and to the use of shocks as generators of impulse-response functions, which are in turn used as data in matching estimators. The history is organized around the observability of shocks. Aswell as documenting a critical conceptual development in economics, the history of shocks provides a case study that illustrates, but also suggests the limitations of, the distinction drawn by the philosophers of science James Bogen and James Woodward between data and phenomena. The history of shocks shows that this distinction must be substantially relativized if it is to be at all plausible."

      "We examine the gender wealth gap with a focus on pension wealth and statutory pension rights. By taking into account employment characteristics of women and men, we are able and identify the extent to which the redistributive effect of pension rights reduces the gap. The empirical basis of this examination is the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), which is one of the few datasets where information on wealth as well as on pension entitlements is collected at the individual level. Pension wealth data is available for 2012 only. Individual level wealth data allows to analyze the gender wealth gap between women and men across all households. Due to the longitudinal character of the underlying data, detailed information on employment trajectories and family related events (such as childbirth, marriage, divorce, widowhood, etc.), which can have an effect on (public) pension entitlements are considered."

      "This paper argues that trade and capital account reforms within autocracies underlie the primacy of foreign currency procurement. A longitudinal comparison of four countries (Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan) in the Middle East and North Africa region shows a historical sequencing of reforms. In the 1960s and 1970s, the foreign exchange scarcity was managed primarily by rising restrictions, accumulation of debt and a number of unilateral country-specific strategies, including broader economic openings (infitah) and isolated capital account liberalizations. However, IMF-friendly reforms (orthodox trade liberalization) only became a political option in the context of the extreme fiscal scarcity of the 1980s and 1990s, after the failure of these earlier policies and the drying up of alternative unconditional finance. Additionally, the time differences regarding when orthodox reforms are implemented within autocracies mainly relate to global and regional cycles of different external windfall gains. These findings complement recent debates about the rush to free trade in at least two regards. First, they point to distinct causal mechanisms depending on the type of political regime (for example, autocracy versus democracy), explaining the beginning of trade and capital account liberalizations among developing countries. Second, they reveal the conditional historical influence of neoliberal ideas among structurally similar autocracies.",
      "Im Papier wird argumentiert, dass die Reform von Außenwirtschaftsbarrieren innerhalb von Autokratien dem Primat der Devisenbewirtschaftung unterliegt. Ein historischer Vergleich von vier Staaten (Marokko, Tunesien, Ägypten und Jordanien) in der Region Nahund Mittelost verweist auf eine historische Sequenz von Reformen. In den 1960er und 1970er Jahren reagierten die untersuchten Staaten auf Devisenknappheit mit steigenden außenwirtschaftlichen Regulierungsniveaus, externer Verschuldung und einer Reihe von unilateralen länderspezifischen Strategien, wie ökonomischer Öffnung (infitah) und selektiver Liberalisierung des Zahlungsverkehrs. IWF-induzierte Reformen (orthodoxe Außenwirtschaftsliberalisierung) wurde darauf folgend erst im Kontext extremer fiskalischer Krisen in den 1980ern und 1990ern opportun, nachdem diese früheren Reformen gescheitert und alternative nicht-konditionale Finanzierungsformen ausgetrocknet waren. Zeitliche Unterschiede bei der Implementierung orthodoxer Reformen lassen sich daher am besten mit Blick auf global und regional unterschiedliche Zyklen externer staatlicher Renteneinnahmen verstehen. Diese Erkenntnisse ergänzen aktuelle Debatten in Bezug auf die Determinanten von außenwirtschaftlicher Liberalisierung in mindestens zwei Aspekten: Erstens wird auf unterschiedliche kausale Mechanismen in Abhängigkeit vom Regimetyp (z. B. Autokratie versus Demokratie) verwiesen, um den Beginn von Außenwirtschaftsliberalisierung in Entwicklungsländern zu erklären. Zweitens wird auf den kontextuellen historischen Einfluss der neo-liberalen Beratungspraxis innerhalb strukturell ähnlich aufgebauter Autokratien aufmerksam gemacht."

      "The paper examines the extent to which the prestige value of a retiree's former occupation increases the likelihood that they will make a transition into volunteering after retirement. Following social production function theory, we assume that when a person retires, the prestige value attached to their former occupation fades. The fact that volunteering has the character of a collective good provides the opportunity to gain social prestige to offset the loss of occupational prestige. However, the extent of the incentive to volunteer will be distributed unequally across occupations: the higher the former occupational prestige value, the higher the perceived loss of prestige after retirement. Thus, doing a job with high prestige value increases the incentive to volunteer in retirement. This assumption is tested, using data taken from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) 1992 - 2013. The sample contains 1,631 workers and 589 retirees, 278 of whom transitioned into volunteering during the observation window. Based on Kaplan-Meier-Failure-Estimates and complementary log-log hazard models, findings show a positive effect of occupational prestige on the transition into volunteering. Thus, the loss of high occupational prestige can be compensated by the social prestige associated with volunteering. Formal volunteering in retirement follows, albeit to a lesser extent, the logic of the occupational social strata."

      "India's automotive sector has grown tremendously in the post-liberalization period. The growing domestic market, increased export opportunities and greater emphasis of vehicle manufacturers on high-quality, innovative solutions have created a context for component suppliers to ramp up their innovation capabilities as well. For about past 20 years the auto component industry has consistently acted as a key enabler of various frugal vehicles launched in India. Our multi-level and multi-approach study, making use of firm and sector-level data while combining case studies with expert interviews, seeks to investigate the prevalent innovation pathways and trajectories in India's Auto Component Industry. The results indicate that firms often engage in designing and developing components making use of modern, digital technologies, and manage to reach very high levels of process and resource efficiency. The huge domestic market, and the rising global demand, for affordable, high quality products provide good incentives for investments and openness for external knowledge. Cooperation between Indian and global companies as well as mergers and acquisitions have accelerated the development of innovation capabilities in India. The focused approach on developing concrete applications within requisite parameters gives rise to \"appropriate solutions\" that balance economic, ecological and technological performance. The study discovered a remarkable set of innovation pathways that makes use of collaborative development, avoids over-engineering and is often driven by economies of scale. All this is also stimulated by the state that developed into a key promoter of innovations."

      "Can securities be settled on a blockchain and, if so, what are the gains relative to existing settlement systems? We consider a blockchain that ensures delivery-vs-payment by linking transfers of assets with payments and operates via a Proof-of-Work protocol. The main problem is to overcome settlement fails where participants fork the chain to get rid of trading losses. To deter forking, the blockchain needs to restrict block size and block time in order to generate sufficient transaction fees which finance costly mining. We show that large enough trading volume, sufficiently strong preferences for fast settlement and limited trade size and risk are necessary conditions for blockchain-based settlement to be feasible. Despite mining being a deadweight cost, our estimates based on the market for US corporate debt show that gains from moving to faster and more exible settlement are in the range of 1-4 bps relative to existing legacy settlement systems."

      "From 2001 the fiscal policy in Chile has been based on a structural surplus rule. Under this rule, the government is committing itself to maintain its expenditures equal to the structural revenue minus the target for the structural surplus, which is expressed in terms of the GDP. The calculation of the structural balance depends on trend output, the long-run copper price and the structural income from Codelco's molybdenum sale. While the latter is calculated with a reference price determined as the average of past prices, panels of independent experts, who meet once a year, determine the two former. The fact that independent experts have substantial influence on the fiscal budget makes the Chilean fiscal rule different from similar rules applied in other countries. Compliance with the rule is not a legal obligation but a voluntary undertaking on the part of the government. Although the fiscal revenue has increased substantially in recent years due to a soaring copper price, the structural balance has remained stable at 1 % of the GDP. Hence, public saving has increased rapidly, accumulating in two sovereign wealth funds, which are administered by the Central Bank."

      "The technology associated with artificial intelligence is developing rapidly. As a consequence, artificial intelligence is being applied in many spheres of life and increasingly affects the functioning of society. Actions of artificial intelligence may cause harm (e.g. in the case of autonomous vehicles that cause traffic accidents). Rules of civil law, especially those relating to liability for damage resulting from somebody's fault or risk, came into being before artificial intelligence's invention and mostly before the latter's significant recent development. They include the Polish Code of civil procedure, which addresses the issues associated with liability, adopted in 1964 and still in force today, although with certain amendments. Therefore, no provisions that would directly refer to artificial intelligence and legal consequences of its actions have been introduced into the Polish civil law. The same applies to European law. Therefore, the issue of whether existing regulations may be applied in the case of artificial intelligence or, perhaps, whether they should be appropriately adjusted, needs to be analysed. The starting point for this analysis is the possibility of conferring upon artificial intelligence the status of an entity under the law, allowing it to independently bear the liability for the damage caused by it. This issue needs to be examined in the context of technology used today (e.g. autonomous vehicles), and also in the future. The analysis performed herein specifies who would bear liability for the actions of artificial intelligence. The deliberations in this area are based on the achievements of Polish and European legal science. Therefore, the conclusions formulated in the article regarding legislative changes apply to all national legal orders informed by European civil law principles."

      "There has been a recent surge in research on long term African development. For this research agenda to be fruitful and its theories, it is crucial to have consistent estimates of economic change. This paper contributes with a new GDP time series for Ghana, 1891-1954. The series implies a sustained period of economic expansion from the late 19th century into the 1960s. This suggests a revision of some prevalent truths about the history of economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. The paper discusses the potential of creating historical national accounts for other African economies across the colonial and post-colonial period."

      "This paper examines the Balance-of-Payment (BOP) constraint growth model in Nigeria for the period of 1980 to 2012 using the bounds testing Auto regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach. The ARDL test suggests that the variables in the framework have a long run relationship. The empirical findings reveal that import is cointegrated with relative price and income, and the equilibrium growth rates coincide with actual growth rates, hence, the result shows that the Thirlwall's law, of actual growth rate being equal to the predicted growth rate by the balance of payment current account equilibrium holds in Nigeria. This reason may be due the fact that the economy of Nigeria depends mainly on international trade even though oil dominates the export. This Thirlwall's BOP-constrained growth approach provides some significant policy prescriptions for Nigeria's development policy. Achievement of potential growth can be stimulated by making exports more competitive through macroeconomic stability, sound institutional qualities, improvement in human and physical capital development, reducing access problems to external market, among other factors."

      "We study the effect of exposure to colonial public primary education on contemporary education outcomes in Tunisia. We assemble a new data set on the location of schools with the number of pupils by origin, along with population data during the French protectorate (1881-1956). We match those with contemporary data on education at both district and individual level. We find that the exposure of local population to colonial public primary education has a long-lasting effect on educational outcomes, even when controlling for colonial investments in education. A one per cent increase in Tunisian enrolment rate in 1931 is associated with a 1.69 percentage pointsincrease in literacy rate in 2014. Our results are driven by older generations, namely individuals who attended primary schools before the 1989/91 education reform. We suggest that the efforts undertaken by the Tunisian government after independence to promote schooling finally paid off after 40 years and overturned the effects of history."

Our results support past findings that economic strength, infrastructure and knowledge of the English language positively affect Internet connectivity. In addition to these indicators, the openness of a country, tertiary enrollment, and income equality are found to also have a significant positive effect on Internet diffusion."

      "Taking the family as the rural-to-urban migration decision-making unit, will the “expected-income migration model” accurately predict the level of migration? Consideration of two variables - desire for leisure, and a version to risk - serves to show that the expected-income model yields a systematic downward bias in the predicted level of rural-to-urban migration. Likely policy implications emanating from the incorporation of these variables in the migration decision are indicated."

      "This paper performs a cross-country level analysis on the impact of the level of specific youth minimum wages on the labor market performance of young individuals. We use information on the use and level of youth minimum wages, as compared to the level of adult minimum wages as well as to the median wage (i.e., the Kaitz index). We complement these data with variables on the employment, labor force participation, and unemployment rates of 5-year age interval categories-all derived from the official OECD database. We distinguish between countries without minimum wages, countries with uniform minimum wages for all age groups, and countries with separate youth and adult minimum wages. Our results indicate that the relative employment rates of young individuals below the age of 25-as compared to the older workers-in countries with youth minimum wages are close to those in countries without minimum wages at all. Turning to the smaller sample of countries with minimum wages, increases in the level of (youth) minimum wages exert a substantial negative impact on the employment rate for young individuals."

      "This paper aims to understand and examine one of the domestic determinants of Brazilian foreign trade policy strategies from 1995 to 2010, focusing on the articulation of its trade policy with its foreign policy at large. Thus, the role of multilateralism and regionalism in Brazilian foreign policy is analyzed in order to identify and understand Brazil's trade negotiation strategies in the period under review. With this work, I try to shed light on the debate about domestic determinants of foreign trade policy in Brazil in recent decades, explaining the adoption of a three-tracks negotiating strategy, which combines the multilateral approach with a two-speed regionalism."

      "The rise in executive compensation has triggered a great amount of public controversy and academic research. Critics have referred to the salaries paid to managers as 'pay without performance', while defenders have countered that the large salaries can be explained by a 'war for talents'. This research tests whether a war for talent provides an explanation. The rise in executive compensation in recent years is explained by the assumption that, over the past decades, general managerial skills have become more important relative to firm-specific knowledge for the production of managers. A shift toward transferable managerial skills requires higher compensation, particularly in large firms, to attract and retain managerial talents. Relying on an internationalized and deregulated managerial labor market, i.e. the Swiss banking sector, the empirical findings confirm that a shift toward transferable managerial skills in large firms is indeed an explanation for the rise in executive compensation. However, the shift towards transferable managerial skills in large firms does not improve firm performance, giving no supporting evidence for a war for talent. It is discussed how transferable managerial skills may used to legitimize higher compensation at the top, e.g. by promulgating definitions of talent in elite labour markets."

      "The combination of credit constraints and indivisible consumption goods may induce some riskaverse individuals to play lotteries to have a chance of crossing a purchasing threshold. One implication of this is that income effects for individuals who choose to play lotteries are likely to be larger than for the general population. Using UK data on lottery wins, other windfalls and durable good purchases, we show that lottery players display higher income effects than non-players but only amongst those likely to be credit constrained. This is consistent with credit constrained, risk-averse agents gambling to convexify their budget set."

      "In March 2004, Ireland became the first country to introduce a nationwide workplace smoking ban. The smoking ban increased the non-monetary cost of smoking by prohibiting smoking in the majority of indoor workplaces. The aim of this paper is to examine whether the extra non-monetary cost of smoking was concentrated on the employed. Using two waves of the nationally representative Slán survey, a difference-in-differences approach is used to measure changes in smoking behaviour among the employed relative to the non-working population following the introduction of the workplace smoking ban. By isolating those workers most affected by the ban, the research finds that the workplace smoking ban did not induce a greater reduction in smoking prevalence among the employed population compared to the non-working population. In fact, the evidence suggests a significantly larger decrease in smoking prevalence among the non-workers relative to the employed. This pattern is particularly strong for occasional smokers. Changes in the real price of cigarettes and changes in attitudes to risk are discussed as possible causes for the pattern observed."

      "The objective of the study is to analyze the cyclicality of Fiscal Policy among Institutions (Economic and Political) and governance indicators from 1980-2010 in major South Asian Countries. Fiscal policy is a major source in the hands of the government to achieve higher level of economic growth. This policy can perform efficiently in the presence of strong institutions with good governance. The main purpose of fiscal policy is to bring stability in the economy. Therefore, developed countries adopt counter cyclical policies but developing countries adopt pro cyclical fiscal policy. Developing countries adopt pro cyclical fiscal policy due to weak institution and poor governance. Pooled OLS, Fixed effects and 2SLS approaches are used to evaluate whether the fiscal policy is counter cyclical or pro cyclical. It is found that fiscal policy is pro cyclical, economic and political institutions don't perform effectively and governance is poor. In order to bring stability in economic growth in South Asian countries, counter cyclical growth policies should be adopted."

      "Die gesetzlichen Regelungen zur betrieblichen Mitbestimmung räumen Arbeitnehmer umfangreiche Mitwirkungs- und Kontrollrechte ein. Diese Ausdünnung der Eigentumsrechte an Unternehmen ist nicht zwangsläufig ineffizient. Mitbestimmung kann auch als Sicherungsmechanismus gegen opportunistische Ausnutzung spezifischer Ausbildungsinvestitionen der Arbeitnehmer gesehen werden. Im Sinne einer konstitutionellen Selbstbindung hätten dann sogar die Arbeitgeber selber ein Interesse an der Einführung der Mitbestimmung. Das Paper diskutiert vier Spiele, die sich danach unterscheiden, ob es die Arbeitnehmer oder die Arbeitgeber sind, die zunächst über die Einführung der Mitbestimmung entscheiden und später die Kosten der Mitbestimmung tragen. Dabei zeigt sich, daß es sinnvoll sein kann, die Einführungsentscheidung von der Kostentraglast zu trennen.",
      "The laws on codetermination in Germany provide enormous rights for employees to control and influence the decisions of firms. This weakens the owenrs' property rights, which, however, is not necessarily inefficient. Codetermination can be seen as a safeguard against opportunistic exploitation of employees' specific investments. Employers then would have a self-interest in legal provision of codetermination. The paper analyzes four different institutional arrangements, distinguishing whether employers or employees decide if codetermination is established, and which party is to bear the costs of codetermination. According to the model, it can be efficient that employees decide to introduce codetermination, whereas the employers have to bear the costs."

      "Using Mexican data on household time use and consumption, we find significant substitution between goods and time in home production and different elasticities of substitution for different household commodities. Adding these findings to the Ramsey optimal tax problem, we show it is optimal to impose higher taxes on market goods used in the production of commodities with a lower elasticity of substitution between goods and time. The reason is that government wants to minimize the distortionary substitution from market purchases toward untaxed time use in home production. This is an analog of the classical Corlett and Hague (1953-1954) result, differing in that we allow for the possibility of substitution between goods and time in the production of commodities. Leaving aside distributional considerations, we conclude that higher taxes should be imposed on market goods used in the production of `Eating' and lower taxes imposed on market goods used in the production of `Recreation'."

      "The present study was carried out to identify the determinants of microcredit accessibility by rural women households and its impact on rural women empowerment in Bangladesh. A face-to-face survey was conducted during 2018, interviewing 300 women households in two locations in Bangladesh. Descriptive statistics and econometric modeling were used to achieve the objectives. The results of the study showed that the higher annual income inversely related with the accessibility to the microcredit program, whereas family size (P < 0.05) was positive and significantly influenced the accessibility to the microcredit program. The empirical results indicate that borrowers of microcredit have greater control over their own savings. The regression outcome also exposes that microcredit has a positive and significant impact on enhancing participation in household decision making process and women's legal awareness. The study suggested that microcredit providers in Bangladesh should be encouraged to review their program planning and redesign loan products by putting more emphasis on higher income group women."

      "This paper takes an otherwise standard real-business-cycle (RBC) setup with government sector, and augments it with an output-expropriation mechanism and shocks to institutional quality in order to study business cycle fluctuations. The extraction decision is endogenous: households can use their time either productively, or engage in opportunistic activities. Stronger institutions decrease the size of the available resources for capture, and suppress corrupt behavior. As a test case, the model is calibrated to Bulgaria after the introduction of the currency board (1999-2018). Overall, the shocks to institutional quality generate business cycles of the same magnitude as in data, which suggests that political economy factors might be the major driving force behind the observed economic fluctuations in Bulgaria. Another interesting result, generated by the model, is that on average, the estimated size of evaded resources is approximately one-fourth of output, which is very close to the estimates of the unofficial economy share, e.g., European Commission (2014) and Medina and Schneider (2017)."

      "This paper provides a novel theory of research joint ventures for financially constrained firms. When firms choose R&D portfolios, an RJV can help to coordinate research efforts, reducing investments in duplicate projects. This can free up resources, increase the variety of pursued projects and thereby increase the probability of discovering the innovation. RJVs improve innovation outcomes when market competition is weak and external financing conditions are bad. An RJV may increase the innovation probability and nevertheless lower total R&D costs. RJVs that increase innovation tend to be profitable, but innovation-reducing RJVs also exist. Finally, we compare RJVs to innovation-enhancing mergers."

      "Trade economists have for long considered gravity models to estimate unexhausted potentials for bilateral trade. Similar to the discrepancy between \"normal\" and \"actual\" bilateral trade, one may ask the question about the difference between \"normal\" and actual bilateral multinational activity. However, with multinational activity, zero bilateral data and heteroscedasticity are very important, even more so than with trade data. Therefore, this paper suggests using generalized linear rather than log-linear models to specify \"normal\" FDI and obtain estimates of unexhausted FDI potentials. I use panel data on Austria?s bilateral multinational activity across 25 countries and 7 country-blocs, 4 sectors and 13 years to illustrate the disadvantage of log-linear model estimation at quasi-maximum likelihood estimation."

      "Narratives - stories - prevail in social life, however little is known about their relation to economic behavior and outcomes. We shed light on this issue by studying the association between folktales' motifs and economic behavior across the world. First, we explore possible relations between the prevalence of narratives and the observed behavior in economic experiments by connecting the Berezkin (2015) collection of narratives with individual choices in experiments performed across the world. Second, we construct a motif distance index that approximates the cultural distance between countries. Third, we provide evidence that motif distance is associated with economic performance."

      "We theoretically and empirically examine how acquiring new skills and increased financial worries influenced entrepreneurship entry and exit intentions during the pandemic. To that end, we analyze primary survey data we collected in the aftermath of the COVID-19's first wave in Russia, which has had one of the highest COVID-19 infection rates globally. Our results show that acquiring new skills during the pandemic helps maintain an existing business and encourages start-ups in sectors other than information technology (IT). For IT start-ups, having previous experience matters more than new skills. While the pandemic-driven financial worries are associated with business closure intentions, they also inspire new business start-ups, highlighting the creative destruction power of the pandemic. Furthermore, preferences for formal employment and remote work also matter for entrepreneurial intentions. Our findings enhance the understanding of entrepreneurship formation and closure in a time of adversity and suggest that implementing entrepreneurship training and upskilling policies during the pandemic can be an important policy tool for innovative small business development."

      "This paper addresses the problem of the dualism of the Italian economy, particularly of its labor market. Although the Italian labor market is considered to be the most highly regulated among OECD countries, the unemployment rate in the North, which represents two thirds of the whole economy, is one of the lowest in Europe. In contrast, the South faces an unemployment rate between two to five times higher than the North. GDP per capita is also twice in the North than in the South, while nominal wages do not differ substantially across regions. Finally internal migration is the lowest among European countries since the middle seventies. This paper argues that the uniform wage is the result of the centralized wage setting carried on by unions, and that the absence of migration is the result of the proactive role of the government, which in the seventies stopped the mass internal migration from the South to the North and since then is acting to prevent the reappearance of such phenomenon. Uniform wage across regions, the active role of the government to prevent internal mass migration and a structural productivity divide between North and South are the institutional features that, within a general equilibrium matching model, explain the high unemployment rate in the South and, perhaps more interestingly, the low unemployment rate accompanied by low wages in the North even when compared to other western European countries."

      "This paper develops a model of crime analyzing how such behavior is associated with individual and neighborhood poverty. The model shows that even under relatively minimal assumptions, a connection between individual poverty and both property and violent crimes will arise, and moreover, neighborhood effects can develop, but will differ substantially in nature across crime types. A key implication is that greater economic segregation in a city should have no effect or a negative effect on property crime, but a positive effect on violent crime. Using IV methods, I show this implication to be consistent with the empirical evidence."

I show that: (i) financial wealth effects are relatively large and statistically significant; (ii) housing wealth effects are virtually nil and not significant; (iii) consumption growth exhibits strong persistence and responds sluggishly to shocks; and (iv) the immediate response of consumption to wealth is substantially different from the longrun wealth effects. By disaggregating financial wealth into its major components, the estimates suggest that wealth effects are particularly large for currency and deposits, and shares and mutual funds. In addition, consumption seems to be very responsive to financial liabilities and mortgage loans."

A mixed method approach has been rarely utilized in the analysis of CSR reporting. To analyze CSR reports the paper uses a two-dimensional conceptual framework based on Wood (Acad Manag Rev 16:691-717, 1991); Jamali and Mirshak (J Bus Ethics 72:243-262, 2007) and Lockett, Moon and Visser (J Manag Stud 43:115-136, 2006); Moon and Shen (J Bus Ethics 94:613-629, 2010). The findings indicate that quantitatively Chinese MNEs display patterns of CSR reporting comparable to major MNEs in developed economies. This paper argues that just like MNEs from developed economies Chinese MNEs use a global CSR reporting template as a convenient tool to align and harmonize various isomorphic pressures. However, qualitatively substantive discrepancies in content have been also identified due to national or other contextual characteristics. The analysis reveals a complex picture of national and international isomorphic forces at play. The paper addresses the lack of consensus concerning convergence/divergence of CSR reporting across the globe and, more specifically, between developed economies and emerging markets. In this respect this paper responds to the general call for research looking into various aspects of business operations, including CSR reporting, of MNEs from emerging markets."

      "The Chinese blockchain industry and market have unique, unusual and idiosyncratic characteristics. Several established companies as well as startups in China have developed and deployed innovative solutions involving blockchain. On the other hand, some uses of blockchain such as initial coin offering for capital-raising have been banned. While blockchain is a disruptive technology with a potential to transform the economy and society, it promotes decentralized governance and thus can turn centralized political structures such as those of China upside down. This paper offers an analysis of seemingly conflicting actions of the Chinese government on the blockchain front. It analyzes how China is creating a delicate balance between encouraging the use of blockchain for the growth and modernization of the economy and making sure that the technology is not used to threaten the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party."

      "Migration movements may increase the geographic dispersion of the Aversion to Breaking Rules (ABR) in a population, with possible long-term economic consequences. We show this result with Italian Census data, using indicators of false birth date registrations for families of South-North migrants and remainers in the two macro-regions. Within locality×biennium cells, deterrence and cheating benefits are similar in the two groups and thus cheating differences are informative about the underlying ABR, as our theory suggests. We also exploit the Fascist reforms of 1926 as shocks to deterrence, offering additional information on the underlying ABR of migrant and remainer families."

      "The literature suggests that competition among schools might increase quality. However, not much empirical evidence is present as only a few countries allow competition at a large scale. One exception is the Netherlands. Free parental choice is the leading principle of the Dutch education system since the beginning of the 20th century. Based on panel data for the Netherlands we show that there is a relation between competition and student achievement in upper secondary education, but that it is negative. In addition, private schools have higher quality levels."

      "Modern agricultural technologies hold huge potential for increasing productivity and reducing poverty in developing countries. However, adoption levels of these technologies have remained disappointingly low in Africa. This paper analyzes the effect of access to credit on the likelihood of adoption and use intensity of chemical fertilizers using data from large rural surveys in Ethiopia. Using a heteroscedasticity‐based identification strategy to address the endogenous nature of access to credit, we find that access to credit has significant positive effects on adoption and intensity of use of chemical fertilizers. However, important heterogeneities are observed. Credit obtained from formal sources is more important for the intensity of use than for the decision to adopt chemical fertilizers. Credit taken with the primary purpose of financing agricultural inputs is more likely to promote adoption of chemical fertilizers than credit taken per se. Furthermore, reported credit effects are larger when estimated against the sample of credit‐constrained non‐users as compared with the pool of the whole sample of credit non‐users. The results remain robust to several sensitivity analyses. Our results yield useful implications for the design, promotion, and targeting of credit services to leverage their effect on adoption of agricultural technologies."

      "IP provisions in FTAs may have implications on a wide range of public policy areas. A vast academic literature has addressed the \"flexibilities\" available under the TRIPS Agreement and the negative impact of FTAs in relation to access to medicines. For example, the Special Rapporteur on the Right of Everyone to the Enjoyment of the Highest Attainable Standard to Physical and Mental Health noted that the TRIPS Agreement and FTAs have had an adverse impact on prices and availability of medicines, making it difficult for countries to comply with their obligations to respect, protect and fully implement the right to health. He recommended developing countries and LDCs to review their laws and policies and amend them to make full use of the flexibilities available to them. This paper explores the extent to which this recommendation to use \"to the fullest extent possible, remaining public health related flexibilities available\" may be effectively implemented in the context of FTAs. The basic question addressed in this paper is whether contracting parties to FTAs can mitigate their adverse effects through interpretation and implementing regulations."

      "This paper analyzes the effects of pre-lending screening on loan market outcome under oligopolistic competition. Better screening decreases loan interest margins and, provided that the average creditworthiness of borrowers is not too low, increases lending volume. We contrast specifically independent screening to common (correlated) filters, and find that the margins are wider and lending volume higher under independent screening. The determinants of the size of the banking industry are also considered. With common filters, more accurate screening increases banks’ incentives to enter under common filters, while with independent screening these incentives may be undermined. – screening ; common (correlated) filters ; banking competition ; loan pricing ; horizontal differentiation ; entry",
      "Tässä tutkimuksessa analysoidaan pankkien luottoasiakkaisiinsa kohdistaman luottokelpoisuusanalyysin (so. yritystutkimuksen) vaikutuksia luottomarkkinoiden toimintaan. Tulokset osoittavat, että tehokkaampi yritystutkimus kaventaa luottojen korkomarginaaleja sekä voi myös johtaa luotonannon kasvuun, mikäli luotonhakijoiden keskimääräinen luottokelpoisuus on riittävän hyvä. Paperissa tarkastellaan erityisesti luottokelpoisuuden selvittämiseen käytettävien testaus- ja analyysimenetelmien tilastollisen luonteen merkitystä. Havaitaan, että luottojen korkomarginaalit ovat leveämpiä ja luottokanta suurempi, jos pankit käyttävät toisistaan riippumattomia luottokelpoisuuden testausmenetelmiä kuin käytettäessä korreloituneita menetelmiä. Tutkimuksessa käsitellään myös pankkitoimialan kokoa ja alalletuloa. Tuloksien mukaan tehokkaampi luottokelpoisuusanalyysi kannustaa alalletuloon sovellettaessa korreloituneita testejä, mutta voi vähentää pankkien alalletulon kannustimia riippumattomien testausteknologioiden tapauksessa. – yritystutkimus ; korreloituneet luottokelpoisuustestit ; pankkikilpailu ; luottojen hinnoittelu ; tuotedifferentiaatio ; alalletulo"

      "This paper analyzes the distributive impacts of violent conflicts, which is in contrast to previous literature that has focused on the other direction. We use cross-country panel data for the time period 1960-2005 to estimate war-related changes in income inequality. Our results indicate rising levels of inequality during war and especially in the early period of post-war reconstruction. However, we find that this rise in income inequality is not permanent. While inequality peaks around five years after the end of a conflict, it declines again to pre-war levels within the end of the first post-war period. Lagged effects of conflict and only subsequent adjustments of redistributive policies in the period of post-war reconstruction seem to be valid explanations for these patterns of inequality. A series of alternative specifications confirms the main findings of the analysis."

      "Questions surrounding the fight against poverty and social exclusion have become a global priority. Poverty and its causes are perceived as differences in the economic and social development of each individual continent and country. Social risk management was developed by the World Bank as a specific conceptual framework of social protection strategy and includes prevention, mitigation and the management of social risks. The diverging causes of poverty across the European continent assume a different approach in identifying causes and social risk management. An important aspect of the EU's social policy is to combat unemployment and social exclusion with the support of the European fund to help the extreme poor and other EU funds, e.g. EQUAL. The appropriate implementation of social risk management in each country is a prerequisite for reducing extreme poverty. Social risk management as a global strategy to combat poverty and extreme poverty is a challenge in the field of education which offers a new range of views and is generating more complex professional competencies in education and new possibilities for university graduates in the labor market."

      "The case of German reunification has been subject to extensive research on earnings inequality and labor market integration. however, little is known about the development of equality of opportunity (EOp) in East and West Germany after 1990.Using German micro data, we empirically analyze how circumstances beyond the sphere of individual control explain inequality in East and West Germany. Our results suggest that equal opportunities in Germany have grown since reunification. Interestingly, EOp is larger in East than in West Germany."

      "The bulk of innovation subsidies in Finland are allocated to firms in industries where the employment share of “innovators,” i.e., workers who are specialized in R&D&I, is very high. The average subsidy per employee is typically the highest among young firms. At the firm level, an increase in innovation subsidies is typically associated with an inflow of innovators from high-productivity firms. These findings suggest that innovation subsidies contribute to economic renewal and the diffusion of knowledge between firms. Non-innovation subsidies, in contrast, appear to support established industry structures: a large share of them has been granted to relatively old firms within “traditional” manufacturing industries. Since non-innovation subsidies are systematically allocated to different types of firms than innovation subsidies, they may also crowd out resources from firms that receive innovation subsidies, thereby overriding some of the possible beneficial effects of innovation subsidies."

      "Recent studies have documented the growth of earnings inequality in the United States during the 1980s. In contrast to these studies' findings, our analysis of micro data for the former West Germany yields virtually no evidence of growth in earnings inequality over the same period. Between 1978 and 1988, a reduction in the dispersion of earnings among workers in the bottom half of the earnings distribution led to a narrowing of the overall dispersion of earnings in Germany. Earnings differentials across education and age groups remained roughly stable, and there was no general widening of earnings differentials within either education or age groups. German wage setting institutions tend to limit earnings differentials across groups of workers, but differences in wage setting institutions cannot fully explain the differences between trends in earnings inequality in Germany and those in the United States. Both the high quality of the training received by non-college-bound German youth and the fact that the growth of the highly-educated work force did not decelerate in Germany as it did in the United States seem likely to have contributed to these differences."

      "Amidst rapid developments in digital financial technologies, the need for effective Decentralized Finance (DeFi) regulation is at the center of discussions. This paper aims to develop a comprehensive taxonomy for DeFi that brings to the forefront the diverse structures and characteristics of protocols and applications and can serve as a basis for developing regulatory policies. A detailed analysis of 144 DeFi projects is conducted using a qualitative research approach with inductive methodology. Based on the analysis, a taxonomy has been developed, which can be used to assist in the design of regulatory policies. From this taxonomy, five ideas are derived which could serve as a potential basis for designing future regulatory measures. In doing so, the work highlights the need to develop appropriate regulations for the DeFi market, which has been mainly unregulated to date. The findings highlight the need for increased international cooperation among countries to achieve a uniform regulatory regime that accommodates the DeFi industry's dynamic developments. The taxonomy approach developed in this research may prove to be a critical tool to foster this international cooperation and promote uniform regulation."

      "The role of renewable and fossil fuel energy consumption on environmental sustainability remains inconclusive due to varied economic and technological structure. This study provides new insight by assessing the nexus between the utilization of two energy categories - renewable and conventional, environmental quality and economic growth embodying capital, trade openness and government expenditure. A panel data of 45 Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) from 1990 to 2014 was employed in the study. We applied heterogeneous panel data approach and second-generational econometric techniques that permit cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity. The evaluation of long-term effects conducted by AMG, along with CCEMG and MG estimators revealed that besides other factors such as government expenditure, capital, and trade openness, non-renewable and renewable energy utilization significantly contributes to the economic growth of the selected EMDEs. The study acknowledges the trade-off effect between environmental quality and economic growth. Using Dumitrescu and Hurlin test, we found strong evidence to support the feedback hypotheses among renewable energy, consumption of conventional fuels, economic growth and CO2 emissions. From a policy perspective, the empirical findings recommend the implementation of effective policies that promote green power and economic structural adjustment in order to diminish the level of atmospheric CO2 emissions."

This paper questions the role of logistics within this context and raises a claim for a central role in future. It is a revision of a current position of the Scientific Advisory Board of Bundesvereinigung Logistik (BVL). Based on the insight that Logistics 4.0 is a crucial element for the implementation of Industry 4.0 three hypotheses are derived. In further elaboration, the paper introduces a total of 11 key research questions that are of central importance to the research community."

      "We apply the novel approach of Siliverstovs (2015) to modelling data sampled at different frequencies in order to scrutinise the composition of one of the most influential economic indicators in Switzerland. The Purchasing Managers' Index consists of eight sub-indices out of which only five enter the total index with differentiated weights, which were specified for its American counterpart about thirty years ago. In this paper, we address the question whether the current fixed weighting scheme of the PMI components is supported by the data. We find that the relative weights of the PMI components are generally supported by the data, except the fact that one component, found very informative for explaining GDP growth, is currently omitted from the PMI composition."

      "Different disciplines within the social sciences have produced large theoretical and empirical literatures to explain the determinants of anti-immigration attitudes. We bring together these literatures in a unified framework and identify testable hypothesis on what characteristics of the individual and of the local environment are likely to have an impact on anti-immigration attitudes. While most of the previous literature focuses on the explanation of attitudes at the individual level, we focus on the impact on regional characteristics (the local context). Our aim is to explain why people living in different regions differ in terms of their attitudes towards immigration. We isolate the impact of regions from regressions using individual-level data and explain this residual regional heterogeneity in attitudes with aggregate level indicators of regional characteristics. We find that regions with a higher percentage of immigrants born outside the EU and a higher unemployment rate among the immigrant population show a higher probability that natives express negative attitudes to immigration. Regions with a higher unemployment rate among natives however, show less pronounced anti-immigrant attitudes."

      "The strategic monitoring of public policies is both a great lack and a great need for high Brazilian public administration. Among other reasons for this paradox is discussed in the text issues alienation and resignation, both applied to the institutional context. Then the questioning of the proposed strategic monitoring, understood as a methodology that seeks to permanent and systemic way, diagnose and expose weaknesses in selected public policies aimed at expanding the capacity to implement and create inventory of knowledge is made policy. Then, we present the description of the organization and analysis platform, highlighting some of its main categories: organizational capabilities, institutional processes and the delivery of goods and services to society. Finally, we discuss the operationalization of strategic monitoring and its main impediments, such as the difficulty in obtaining information, the resistance of the bureaucracy to systematize and deepen knowledge on public policy, increasing the embarrassment by exposing the weaknesses and low interest information for decision-makers of the genre. With this final reflection is made on the main challenges of strategic monitoring and seek to define possible routes to solve them."

      "The present study examines the health behavior of more than 30,000 individuals aged 25-74 in Austria, using education as an indicator of socioeconomic status. Of particular interest is the magnitude of the educational disparities in health behavior between hypothetical most and least educated, measured by the Relative Index of Inequality. The findings show that education has a great positive impact on the extent to which a person lives a healthy lifestyle with regard to diet, physical activity, and smoking. Furthermore, the prevalence of overweight decreases significantly with any increase in education, and people with more education are also much more likely to get their periodical vaccinations."

      "This paper argues that the effects of the food price crisis of 2007-08 put pressure on two variables that are of central importance to the Brazilian government: inflation and social inclusion. We describe how political institutions in Brazil in the past 25 years have given rise to a policy-making process where fiscal stability and social inclusion are the overarching priorities, irrespective of the party in power. In this scenario one would have expected that the food price crisis would have led to significant reactions by the government to safeguard those two central policy objectives. However, the reaction of the government and social groups was relatively subdued, compared to that in most other countries. We explain this apparent puzzle by showing that the negative impacts of the food price increases on consumers was partly counterbalanced by the benefits from agricultural production, given that Brazil is a major exporter of commodities. Also, before the crisis the country already possessed a series of programmes and mechanisms that offered social protection to the poor that could be easily and quickly adjusted. Brazil was therefore well-placed to deal with the impacts of the crisis."

      "The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-1998 revealed that Asia should have its own regional mechanism to mitigate systemic risk and crisis contagion. This resulted in the formation of several regional organizations, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the People's Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3) Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) whose work supports regional macroprudential schemes and which provides macroprudential surveillance and assistance in financial crisis resolution. Given its small size and lack of authority to enforce its policy recommendations, AMRO is not in a position to replace the dominance of international organizations with more ample resources in resolving financial crises. AMRO can be more effective in early warning than in crisis resolution. Its work should be supported and expanded, while increasing coordination with other international organizations to strengthen the macroprudential ability of the Asian region. The Southeast Asian Central Banks Research and Training Centre (SEACEN) provides training to central bankers, research on central banking, and fosters networking among members. Its work contributes indirectly to macroprudential schemes through upgrading the capabilities and relationships of members' central banking staff. SEACEN can become more effective if it streamlines its work focus and collaborates more with other organizations. The Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) organizes meetings for governors and deputy governors of its members' central banks in order to dialogue and exchange ideas. These meetings have indirect and long-term benefits as they help to enhance regional macroprudential schemes by fostering relationships and interactions among the top decision makers. EMEAP may become more effective and prominent if it makes its work and plans more transparent. In addition, several other high-level meetings such as ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors' Meeting, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and Asia-Europe Meeting provide opportunities for policy dialogues for their members, which indirectly enhance their macroprudential efforts. But, due to the nature of the work objectives, and/or relatively small sizes of these regional organizations, they should be viewed as useful supplements to existing international organizations rather than their replacements."

      "The clock is ticking and time is running short for us to have a realistic chance to get climate change under control and prevent it becoming irreversible and selfsustaining. Phasing out coal is widely seen as a 'low hanging fruit' of climate policy commitments in the move towards a net zero carbon economy by 2050. Coalbased energy generation and use made up 15 per cent of total EU greenhouse gas emissions in 2017; while, at the same time, these have a rather low share in the total economy and employment. On the other hand, coal-dependent activities are concentrated in a small number of European regions where they provide the main basis for the economy, employment and the livelihoods of people. If properlydesigned just transition policies can have a meaningful effect, then coal transition is the right place to start. The focus of this working paper is to find out what a just coal transition might look like in practice. After summing up the role of coal in the European economy and in employment, the current employment structure of the broader coal sector will be examined in greater detail. Then, by discussing the drivers and challenges of coal transition, we will provide an insight into the phasing out of coal and the related introduction of just transition policies in a number of EU member states. This working paper will conclude that, in order to fulfil mid-century climate policy targets and manage a successful phase-out of coal in the energy sector, specific and targeted just coal transition policies should be applied."

      "In the Norwegian national accounts, as in many other countries, it is quite common to use information on depreciation rates and profiles based on studies from the US, Canada and the Netherlands due to a lack of national studies. We present new results based on a survey of Norwegian firms concerning their perception of the expected economic service life of different types of capital assets and their assessments of the most realistic depreciation profiles. For some capital categories, information on acquisition prices and second-hand market prices were also collected, together with information on the age of capital assets when they were sold in second-hand markets. We present the companies' answers about expected service lives and depreciation profiles, and carry out an econometric analysis for two types of capital where second-hand markets exist, Machinery and equipment for mining and manufacturing, and Tools, instruments, furnishings etc. For the first group, the expected service life is estimated to be between 9 and 10 years, while, for the second group, the estimate is about 8 years. According to the descriptive analysis, the reported mean expected service lives are around 10 and 7 years, respectively. Our results are quite similar to those obtained in the literature."

      "The current study examines individual decision making in the field of personal finance. How do people arrive at a financial decision? A laboratory experiment investigates the way external information is integrated into the decision-making process. Financial literacy shows to lower demand for financial advice but it does not immunize against sunk cost fallacies: High financial literate subjects are not less likely to follow financial advice than less literate subjects, even when the quality of advice is moderate. Overconfidence biases the perceived need for information. Both results point to difficulties in making an informed choice.",
      "Dieses Papier untersucht individuelle Entscheidungsprozesse im Bereich Finanzen. Wie gelangen Menschen zu einer finanziellen Entscheidung? Ein Laborexperiment untersucht, wie externe Informationen in den Entscheidungsprozess integriert werden. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass ein hohes Niveau an financial literacy die Nachfrage nach Ratschlägen senkt. Es bewahrt aber nicht davor, einer sunk cost fallacy zu unterliegen. Menschen mit sehr hoher financial literacy sind nicht weniger geneigt einem Ratschlag in einer finanziellen Entscheidungssituation zu folgen als Menschen mit einer geringen financial literacy, und zwar auch dann nicht, wenn die Qualität dieses Ratschlags nur moderat ist. Außerdem zeigen die Ergebnisse, wie der wahrgenommene Bedarf an Informationen durch overconfidence verzerrt wird. Beide Ergebnisse zeigen, inwiefern der Anspruch, eine fundierte Entscheidung zu treffen für Individuen mit Schwierigkeiten verbunden ist, selbst wenn eine Vielzahl externer Informationen verfügbar ist."

      "In every society for which we have data, people's educational achievement is positively correlated with their parents' education or with other indicators of their parents' socioeconomic status. This topic is central in social science, and there is no doubt that research has intensified during recent decades, not least thanks to better data having become accessible to researchers. The purpose of this chapter is to summarize and evaluate recent empirical research on education and family background. Broadly speaking, we focus on two related but distinct motivations for this topic. The first is equality of opportunity. Here, major the research issues are: How important a determinant of educational attainment is family background, and is family background - in the broad sense that incorporates factors not chosen by the individual - a major, or only a minor, determinant of educational attainment? What are the mechanisms that make family background important? Have specific policy reforms been successful in reducing the impact of family background on educational achievement? The second common starting point for recent research has been the child development perspective. Here, the focus is on how human-capital accumulation is affected by early childhood resources. Studies with this focus address the questions: what types of parental resources or inputs are important for children's development, why are they important and when are they important? In addition, this literature focuses on exploring which types of economic policy, and what timing of the policy in relation to children's social and cognitive development, are conducive to children's performance and adult outcomes. The policy interest in this research is whether policies that change parents' resources and restrictions have causal effects on their children."

      "This paper tests three hypotheses concerning intra-household resource allocation in rural China. First, whether increasing the women's bargaining power alters household expenditure patterns. Second, whether households allocate fewer resources to daughters than to sons. Third, whether increasing the bargaining power of women reduces pro-boy discrimination. We find that expenditure patterns do vary with proxies for women's bargaining power. Pro-boy discrimination is suggested by: lower female outlay equivalent ratios for adult goods; greater sensitivity of household health spending to young boys than to young girls; and high male sex ratios. No evidence is found to support the third hypothesis."

      "Das Produktionspotential der Liechtensteiner Volkswirtschaft hat sich in den vergangenen 60 Jahren im internationalen Vergleich ausserordentlich dynamisch entwickelt. Die Beschäftigung zeigt sich dabei als wichtigster Wachstumstreiber. Die expansive Entwicklung blieb jedoch nicht ungebrochen. Insbesondere zum Ende der 1990er Jahre ist eine merkliche Verlangsamung des Potentialwachstums zu beobachten. Ursächlich hierfür ist vor allem die rückläufige Dynamik der Arbeitsproduktivität. Über den gesamten Untersuchungszeitraum lassen sich am Standort Liechtenstein drei Phasen des Potentialwachstums unterscheiden. Methodisch wird in der vorliegenden Untersuchung das Produktionspotential als statis-tische Trendkomponente des Bruttoinlandprodukts interpretiert."

      "Ergänzend zu den Beiträgen, die im ifo Schnelldienst Nr. 10/2006 zur Föderalismusreform veröffentlicht wurden, stellt Bernhard Kempen, Deutscher Hochschulverband, seine Meinung zu diesem Reformvorhaben vor. Seiner Ansicht nach droht durch die Föderalismusreform \"die sachbezogen austarierte Balance zwischen belebender föderaler Vielfalt und staatsnotwendiger Einheitlichkeit aus dem Gleichgewicht zu geraten. Im Verlauf der weniger sach- denn machtbezogen geführten Reformdiskussion sah sich der Bund genötigt, auch solche Zuständigkeiten preiszugeben, deren Ausübung zur Herstellung einheitlicher Lebensverhältnisse oder zur Wahrung der Rechts- und Wirtschaftseinheit er noch vor kurzem für erforderlich hielt.\" Anhand der Beamten- bzw. Professorenbesoldung stellt Kempen dar, welche praktische Auswirkung die Verlagerung von Zuständigkeiten von Bund- auf Länderebene nach sich ziehen kann."

      "Debate over the effects of public versus private health care financing has been, and continues to be, active in both academic outlets and policy circles. Theoretical literature on parallel health care financing is often built on untested behavioural assumptions and the empirical evidence generally depends upon the institutional details of the specific health care systems under analysis. This paper contributes to the literature on parallel health care finance by developing and executing a revealed preference laboratory experiment based on the theoretical model of parallel health care finance in Cuff et al. (2008). The theoretical model involves individuals with varying severities of illness who demand health care from a limited supply of health care resources. Health care resources are purchased by the public sector and rationed free of charge to individuals, or purchased by individuals through a private insurance market. The general theoretical model is converted into a discrete experimental representation of a large-scale economy where individuals are price takers, the probability of receiving public health care is exogenous and the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for private health insurance is elicited from subjects. The experimental design includes two within-subject factors based on the theoretical model: the public sector rationing rule (rationing based on need or severity versus rationing based on a random allocation) and the probability of being publicly treated (high versus low). The experimental design also includes two between-subjects treatments based on the frame of the experiment (neutral frame versus health frame) and on the distribution of private health insurance prices (high prices versus low prices). The results show the public system's allocation rule and the probability of receiving health care from the public system both significantly affect an individual's WTP for private health insurance in the predicted direction, although the WTP values tend to be above the actual theoretical predictions. When the public system allocates health care based on need, the average WTP is lower than under random allocation. A higher probability of receiving health care from the public system elicits a lower WTP regardless of how the public system allocates health care. It is also found that when the public system allocates health care based on need, the WTPs are significantly higher under a neutral frame than a health frame."

      "The economic and financial crisis of 2008 disrupted the European Union's (EU) enlarge&#x00ad;ment policy for the Western Balkans. At least since that time, the region has seen greater involvement by economic actors from non-EU countries such as China, Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Their engagement has been most evident in the areas of direct investment, trade and energy security. Investments from these countries can increase the risk of 'corrosive capital', which could have a negative impact on the development of the rule of law and democracy in the Western Balkans. In view of a visibly intensifying rivalry between the EU on the one hand and Russia and China on the other, the question therefore arises as to how the EU can react to and strategically counteract the intensified economic interconnectedness of the West&#x00ad;ern Balkans with these actors."

      "A two-country model of oligopoly in general equilibrium is used to show how changes in market structure accompany the process of trade and capital market liberalisation. The model predicts that bilateral mergers in which low-cost firms buy out higher-cost foreign rivals are profitable under Cournot competition. With symmetric countries, welfare may rise or fall, though the distribution of income always shifts towards profits. The model implies that trade liberalisation can trigger international merger waves, in the process encouraging countries to specialise and trade more in accordance with comparative advantage."

      "This paper analyzes the determinants of local institutions and distribution of political power within a constant 'macro-institutional' setting. We show that characteristics of Brazilian municipalities related to institutional quality and distribution of political power are partly inherited from the colonial histories experienced by different areas of the country. Municipalities with origins tracing back to the sugar-cane colonial cycle characterized by a polarized and oligarchic socioeconomic structure display today more inequality in the distribution of endowments (land). Municipalities with origins tracing back to the gold colonial cycle characterized by a heavily inefficient presence of the Portuguese state display today worse governance practices and less access to justice. The colonial rent-seeking episodes are also correlated with lower provision of public goods and lower income per capita."

      "Commitments in regional trade agreements (RTAs) that fall short of the same countries' obligations under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) are a relatively frequent phenomenon. However, they have gone widely unnoticed in the literature to date and drawn very little attention in relevant WTO fora either. Nevertheless, 'minus commitments' are potentially poisonous and, for various reasons, would deserve close attention. Given the broad definitional scope of the GATS, extending inter alia to commercial presence, such commitments may impinge upon the rights of third-country investors in the RTA economies. Their existence casts doubts on the legal status of the respective agreements under the GATS and can have severe implications for the trading system overall. If not complemented by comprehensive Most-favoured-Nation clauses, the RTAs concerned are disconnected from the WTO and virtually impossible to multilateralize. Based on a review of some 80,000 commitments in 66 agreements, this study seeks to develop a reasonably comprehensive picture of the frequency of 'minus commitments' and their dosage in terms of sectors, measures and modes of supply. It also discusses potential remedies from a WTO perspective."

      "The recent financial crisis proved that financial contagion could spread among countries resulting in disruptive effects. In this paper, by modeling and simulating banking system behavior and linkages across countries, we assess, based on data from the BIS and IMF, the possible outcome of domestic crises and how contagion spreads over countries. Results allow detailing the role of a \"lighter\" or of a \"fueler\" of financial crises for each country and assessing how each country can affect each other country by contagion, signaling the importance of financial interdependence between some neighboring countries, and detailing which counterpart country would be affected by the ring-fencing of each considered country's banking system. The method also allows for what-if analyses to optimize the risk exposures, and to plan an emergency strategy in case of alarms coming from specific countries."

      "The European Union has weathered a number of turbulent storms in recent years from the COVID-19 pandemic to the ongoing war in Ukraine. These crises have highlighted the limitations of the EU budget and the need for the flexibility to adequately respond to challenges in real time. They have also raised questions about the legal feasibility of more common debt following a dramatic increase in EU borrowing. What are the obstacles - and the opportunities - for the EU's public finances in the face of the numerous crises of our time? Is it possible to balance predictability for long-term investments and flexibility to react to unexpected turns of events? This Forum addresses these questions and builds on the discussions at the 2023 joint Intereconomics/CEPS conference."

      "In 2001, government guarantees for savings banks in Germany were removed following a law suit. We use this natural experiment to examine the effect of government guarantees on bank risk taking, using a large data set of matched bank/borrower information. The results suggest that banks whose government guarantee was removed reduced credit risk by cutting off the riskiest borrowers from credit. At the same time, the banks also increased interest rates on their remaining borrowers. The effects are economically large: the Z-Score of average borrowers increased by 7.5% and the average loan size declined by 17.2%. Remaining borrowers paid 46 basis points higher interest rates, despite their higher quality. Using a difference-in-differences approach we show that the effect is larger for banks that ex ante benefited more from the guarantee and that none of these effects are present in a control group of German banks to whom the guarantee was not applicable. Furthermore, savings banks adjusted their liabilities away from risk-sensitive debt instruments after the removal of the guarantee, while we do not observe this for the control group. We also document in an event study that yield spreads of savings banks’ bonds increased significantly right after the announcement of the decision to remove guarantees, while the yield spread of a sample of bonds issued by the control group remained unchanged. The results suggest that public guarantees may be associated with substantial moral hazard effects."

This study is the first to test this relationship in a between-country and within-country setup; using harmonized micro data from 18 Latin American countries, spanning multiple cohorts. It is shown that experiencing higher income inequality in childhood is associated with lower intergenerational mobility measured in adulthood. Following the same methodology, the influence of economic growth and public education is evaluated: both are positively, significantly, and substantially associated with intergenerational mobility."

Therefore, policies need to be comprehensive and go beyond the support of the ICT sector as well as address a variety of issues: increasing returns to the use of data, heterogeneity of the digital innovation actors and ecosystem, digital skills in the non-ICT sectors, entrepreneurial culture, funding for scaling-up of new entrants, technological interoperability and intellectual property protection. At the same time, they need to counterbalance the costs of digitally driven disruptions. This paper highlights the main peculiarities of digital innovation and its implications for policies aiming at reaping the benefits of digital technologies."

      "This paper provides empirical evidence on the relationship between cross-border acquisitions and innovation activities of the acquirer. For the empirical analysis a unique firm-level data set is constructed that combines survey data for German firms with a merger and acquisition database. After a cross-border acquisition, investing firms display a higher rate of domestic expenditures for research and development. Controlling for endogeneity of foreign acquisitions by estimating a two-equation system with limited dependent variables and applying instrumental variable techniques it is found that part of this correlation stems from a causal effect. The estimated effects are robust towards alternative identification strategies and are higher in industries with high knowledge intensity. The analysis is complemented by an investigation of the effects on tangible investment spending and by a comparison of the effects of cross-border acquisitions to those of greenfield foreign direct investments and domestic acquisitions."

      "With outsourcing comes a perceived tension between the competitive pressures faced by domestic firms and the effect that outsourcing has on domestic workers. To address this tension, we present a general-equilibrium model with an oligopolistic export sector and a competitive import-competing sector. When there is a minimum wage, an outsourcing tax might be desirable and the usual profit-shifting objectives of an export subsidy are mitigated, perhaps completely, because it might lead to higher unemployment. Also, increased international competition has no affect on the level of outsourcing, but the direction of its effect on unemployment and national income depends on the relative factor intensities of the two sectors. Under wage flexibility, an outsourcing tax cannot be justified and the profit-shifting motive is the same as in a model without outsourcing. Further, if export subsidies are not possible due to WTO regulations, it is optimal to subsidize rather than to tax outsourcing. Finally, the effect of increased foreign competition on welfare depends on the relative factor intensities of the two sectors."

      "Bilateral labor agreements (BLAs) are preferred policy models for regulating migration by many governments around the world. The Philippines has been a leader in both agreement conclusion and exporting labor. A recent Congressional evocation is pushing bureaucrats and academics alike to investigate this policy strategy for outcomes and effectiveness. The following analysis answers the question \"Do BLAs affect the migration outflows of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs)?\" using a plausibly exogenous variation to isolate a causal effect. I test for effects of BLAs using two instrumental variables (IVs), such as Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) and Formal Alliances, and an original dataset of land-based and sea-based Filipino BLAs and migrant stock in 213 unique areas from 1960 to 2018. I do not find any empirical evidence that these treaties drive migration. However, BLAs have statistically significant effects on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and exports, suggesting other important channels through which these agreements affect economic outcomes. These null results are critically important for policymakers and diplomats because the resources spent on negotiation are wasted if the primary goal is to increase migration."

      "Using an experimental approach, this paper examines how scarcity of natural resources affects people's readiness to cooperate and to engage in antisocial behaviour. The experiments were carried out with pastoralists from southern Namibia whose livelihoods are highly dependent on grazing availability on their collectively used rangelands. We split the study region into two areas according to exogenous differences in biomass production, a high-yield and a low-yield area, and conduct a one-shot public goods experiment and the joy-of-destruction experiment with pastoralists from both areas. Results from the joy-of-destruction experiment reveal that a substantial fraction of people is willing to reduce another subject's income, although this comes at an own cost. We show that this kind of spiteful behaviour occurs twice as often in the area where resources are scarcer and hence competitive pressure is higher. By contrast, levels of cooperation are very similar across areas. This indicates that scarcity does not hamper cooperation, at least as long as a sub-survival level has not been reached. Our data further reveal a coexistence of prosocial and antisocial behaviour within individuals, suggesting that people's motivations depend on the experimental environment they are acting in. One possible explanation is that subjects are ready to cooperate when substantial net gains can be realized, but turn to spiteful money burners when there is no scope for efficiency improvements and the risk of \"falling behind\" is particularly salient."

      "Mental well-being has declined during the Covid-19 pandemic in several developed countries, and particularly in the UK. Given the resurgence of the disease in western Europe during autumn 2020 and concurrently increasing restrictions, we investigate the possible effect on well-being of a winter lockdown. Using local variation during the spring lockdown in the UK, we found little effect of weather (temperature and rainfall) on well-being. This finding is despite a strong effect of weather on mobility in parks during the same period. Together, our results suggest a limited role for recreational mobility in maintaining well-being during this period. Our evidence suggests that winter weather will not exacerbate the well-being costs of lockdowns."

      "Extractive industries form an important part of the economy for many developing countries, but their impact on growth and welfare remains understudied. With global efforts to transition to net-zero carbon emissions in the coming decades, understanding the local impacts of the extractives sector is crucially important for regional economic development policy in the management of this transition. In this paper we use tax administrative data from South Africa to examine the local spillovers from mining activities, focusing on wages, firm profitability, and job creation. Utilizing exogenous changes in international mineral and metals prices, which had a heterogeneous impact across different local areas depending on the main minerals and metals being extracted, we find that, in the short term, a general contraction in the mining sector reduces the number of jobs in related service industries, as well as the wages received by local workers in those sectors. We also find evidence that a negative shock to the mining sector through vertical integration will have negative productivity impacts on the tradable sectors (especially manufacturing)."

      "In the last two decades remittances have gained interest due to their large size. For several developing countries remittances constitute a large portion of their GDP and sometimes exceed FDI. While FDIs are usually profit driven, it is not clear what the driving force behind remittances is. This paper presents a simple theoretical model of migrants' remitting behavior. I consider two general motivations for remitting: altruism and self-interest. Using a heteroskedastic Tobit with a known form of variance I test the findings of the theoretical model with data from Nicaragua. Evidence suggests that migrants from Nicaragua remit for altruistic reasons. Moreover some gender heterogeneity seems to exist in the remitting behavior."

      "Economic institutions determine prospects for growth and development. This paper examines necessary conditions for an economy to support institutions that implement markets. Agents differ in land holdings, skill, and power. A competitive market assigns land to the skilled, not necessarily to the powerful. Therefore a market allocation needs to be robust to coalitional expropriation. In a dynamic setting, market payoffs may induce sufficient inequality in next period's endowments for markets to alternate with expropriation in a limit cycle, decreasing efficiency and amplifying macroeconomic fluctuations. Long run stability of markets is favored by higher social mobility, more initial equality, and less mismatch between demand and supply."

      "This paper examines the customer value creation framework and discusses the design of the key elements for product development in emerging markets. A scientometric/bibliometric scoping literature review identifies a clear gap in the current research in studying prerequisites for customer value creation in emerging market contexts. Observing experiences of Daikin and Renault in the context of India, the purpose of this paper is to identify value creation strategic choices following which comprehensive customer value offerings in products and services can be successfully created by firms across the four facets of the framework in emerging markets. Value creation strategies include having a nuanced understanding of the latent contextual needs to offer localized high-quality products that embody distinct functional attributes that provide a functional value and being responsive to specific emotional needs and epistemic experiences of the target customers in product and service offerings to deliver a greater experiential value. Furthermore, the products should adopt a localized operational excellence strategy throughout the value chain to reduce costs for competitive price offerings in order to deliver superior cost value and develop brand image and equity strategy, thereby allowing for the provision of a greater symbolic value. Experiences of successful firms demonstrate the need for extensive local research into the emerging market followed by localization of production and development of a distribution network to be able to offer customized products at competitive prices whilst maintaining the brand value. We thus extend the customer value creation framework by introducing localization as a necessary condition for successful organizational performance in emerging markets."

      "We explore the role of firms in insuring non-verifiable output. As a device that allows workers to commit to thedelivery of their output, the firm arises endogenously as an alternative to the market if workers are sufficiently riskaverse and the firm can base its incentive payments on good information. Competition, however, may allow themarket and explicit contracts to crowd out implicit insurance, even though the latter yields higher welfare.Integrating the principal-agent and shirking models, we explain why different contracting modes coexist in quitehomogeneous industries."

      "This study analyzes the effects of additional interconnection on welfare and competition in the Irish electricity market. I simulate the wholesale electricity markets of Great Britain and the island of Ireland for 2005. I find that in order for the two markets to be integrated in 2005, additional interconnection would have to be large. The amount of interconnection decreases for high costs of carbon, since this causes the markets to become more similar. Irish consumers obtain most of the welfare gains of interconnection. As the amount of interconnection increases, there are also positive effects on competition in Ireland, the less competitive of the two markets. Finally, it is unlikely that private investors will pay for the construction of the interconnector since they are unable to extract all its welfare benefits."

      "This study provides a harmonization framework for common capital flight policies in Africa. It builds on evidence of persistent extreme poverty in the continent to assess how common measures can be adopted by sampled countries on one cause of extreme poverty: capital flight. The dataset is sub-divided into fundamental characteristics of African capital flight based on income levels, legal foundations, natural resources, political stability, regional proximity, and religious domination. The main finding shows that from a projection date of 2010, a feasible timeframe for harmonizing policies is between 2016 and 2023. This timeframe coincides with the beginning of the post-2015 agenda on sustainable development goals."

      "This paper proposes an approach to estimate the impact of adverse climatic events on the profitability of small European banks (LSIs). By considering river ooding phenomena, we construct a unique database matching the information on location, frequency and severity of oods with the location and balance sheet data of institutions mainly operating in the areas where they are headquartered (territorial LSIs). We compare the performance of territorial LSIs across regions at low and high ooding risk and test for the \\core lending channel\" hypothesis, whereby lending to the real economy is a catalyst of physical risks. Results show that an adverse event dropping loans to households and non-financial corporations by one percentage point (pp) of total assets entails a decrease in the Return on Assets (ROA) of territorial LSIs in riskier areas by 0.01pps (~3.1%). Moreover, if all territorial LSIs were located in riskier areas, one bank out of two would report an average ROA between 0.0001 and 0.52 percentage points lower than what observed."

      "Fiscal forecasts produced by international institutions came under strong criticism after the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis due to excessive optimism. Presently, international organizations are also accused of applying a double standard. Their opponents claim they depict negative picture for populist governments. This paper evaluates forecasts provided by the IMF, European Commission and the OECD based on a panel of EU economies and selected large countries. Five years after the Sovereign debt crisis, we still find excessively optimistic forecasts for Portugal and Spain. Moreover, the EC and OECD are being indulgent to countries under the excessive deficit procedure. There is also a strong autocorrelation of forecast errors and cyclical biases - European Commission overestimates governments' propensity to tighten fiscal policy during expansion and forecasts an overly pessimistic picture during a slowdown. However, we find no evidence suggesting that fiscal forecasts stigmatize the governments accused of populism."

      "Die globale Finanzkrise und die Krise im Euroraum offenbarten deutliche Schwächen in der Bankenregulierung und -aufsicht. Drei wesentliche Reformstränge sollen das Finanzsystem stärken: die Erhöhung der Eigenkapitalanforderungen für Banken, die Gründung der Europäischen Bankenunion und die Einführung einer makroprudenziellen Regulierung und Aufsicht. Diese Reformen stellen zwar erhebliche Fortschritte dar, sie reichen jedoch nicht aus. Die Eigenkapitalanforderungen sollten vor allem für große Banken stärker erhöht werden. Um den Staaten-Banken-Nexus zu durchbrechen, sollten die Privilegierung von Staatsanleihen in der Bankenregulierung beendet und die Glaubwürdigkeit des Abwicklungsregimes erhöht werden. Eine wirksame makroprudenzielle Aufsicht erfordert eine Ausweitung des Instrumentenkastens sowie eine stärkere Berücksichtigung von Finanzinstitutionen außerhalb des Bankensektors. Rufen nach einer Deregulierung im Finanzsystem ist eine Absage zu erteilen.",
      "The global financial crisis and the euro area crisis revealed clear weaknesses in banking regulation and supervision. Three major reform strands shall strengthen the financial system: an increase in capital requirements for banks, the establishment of the European Banking Union, and the introduction of macroprudential regulation and supervision. While these reforms are significant advances, they are not sufficient. Capital requirements should be increased more, especially for large banks. To break the sovereign-bank nexus, the regulatory privileges for sovereign exposures of banks should be removed and the credibility of the bank resolution regime should be fostered. An effective macroprudential supervision requires an expanded toolkit and an additional focus on financial institutions beyond the banking sector. Calls for deregulation in the financial system should be rejected."

      "Nach herkömmlicher Meinung sind Selbständige - als Freiberufler und Unternehmer (Gewerbetreibende) - nicht nur einkommensreich sondern auch zeitreich, da sie aufgrund ihrer Unabhängigkeit und Zeitsouveränität auch verhältnismäßig viel und disponible Zeit zur Verfügung haben. Unsere Studie untersucht diese These und damit erstmals die Wohlfahrtssituation von Selbständigen indem nicht nur nach der Einkommensarmut gefragt wird, sondern auch Zeitarmut im Rahmen eines neuen interdependenten multidimensionalen Armutskonzepts Berücksichtigung findet. Datenbasis ist einerseits das Sozio-ökonomische Panel für die bevölkerungsrepräsentative Bewertung der Substitutionalität/trade-off zwischen genuiner, persönlicher Freizeit und Einkommen als auch die beiden Zeitbudgeterhebungen 1992/92 und 2001/2 des Statistischen Bundesamtes. Zentrales Ergebnis: Selbständige sind hinsichtlich alleiniger Einkommensarmut,alleiniger Zeitarmut und interdependenter multidimensionaler Zeit- und Einkommensarmut in beiden Jahren weit stärker betroffen als alle anderen Gruppen der armen Erwerbstätigen, der working poor. Ein erheblicher Anteil von nicht-einkommensarmen aber zeitarmen Erwerbstätigen generell, und Selbständige im Besonderen, ist nicht in der Lage, ihr Zeitdefizit durch ihr Einkommen zu kompensieren. Würde man Selbständige bei der Armuts- und Wohlfahrtsdiskussion außen vor lassen, so würde eine bedeutende Gruppe der working poor zu unrecht vernachlässigt.",
      "It is common sense that the self-employed - as professions and entrepreneurs - are rich by money and, because of their independence and time sovereignty, are rich by time, too. However, time stress and the variety of small businesses sometimes tell another story. This study tries to shed empirically based light on the issue and its dynamics by asking not only about income poverty but also about time poverty within the framework of a new interdependent multidimensional poverty approach. Database is the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) for the evaluation of the substitution/trade-off of genuine leisure time and income as well as the German Time Use Surveys (GTUS) 1991/92 and 2001/02 for the actual poverty analyses. Main result: The self-employed are more often affected by single income poverty, single time poverty as well as interdependent multidimensional time and income poverty than all other poor employees (working poor) for both periods of observation. A remarkable percentage of not income poor but time poor employees in general, and the self-employed in particular, is not able to compensate their time deficit by income. Neglecting the self-employed in the poverty and well-being discussion would disregard an important group of the working poor."

The first command allows the user to test whether consumer demand data satisfy a number of revealed preference axioms at a given efficiency level, the second command calculates measures of goodness-of-fit when the data violate these axioms, and the third command calculates power against uniformly random behavior as well as predictive success for each axiom at any given efficiency level. The commands are illustrated using experimental individual-level data and aggregated household-level consumption data."

      "Combining nationally representative administrative and survey data with official proxy means testing models and coefficients, we evaluate Indonesia's three largest social programs. The setting for our evaluation is the launch of Indonesia's Unified Targeting system, an innovation developed to reduce targeting errors and increase program complementarities. Introducing a new method of evaluation under the condition of multiple programs, we show that households receiving all three programs are at least 30 percentage points better off than those receiving none. Importantly, the bias from failing to account for program complementarities is greater in magnitude than the benefits of receiving a single program."

      "We study the influence of taxation on labour supply using a specifically designed representative survey of the German population. First, we investigate whether taxes generally matter for the labour supply decisions of our respondents. Around 41 per cent report taking taxes into consideration, which implies that the majority of the German population appears unresponsive to taxation. Second, we look at self-reported labour supply adjustments following a recently enacted payroll tax change. Only around 12 per cent of all respondents report an actual labour supply response, but we find evidence of an income, as well as a substitution, effect of the tax change. Our conclusion is that effects of taxes on labour supply in Germany are likely small. We analyse the correlation with economic and socio-demographic variables, and find that the self-employed are relatively more sensitive to taxation and that low interest rates reduce incentives for an expansion of the labour supply."

      "The majority of classic SPC methodologies assume a steady-state (i.e., static) process behavior (i.e., the process mean and variance are constant) without the influence of the dynamic behavior (i.e., an intended or unintended shift in the process mean or variance). Traditional SPC has been successfully used in steady-state manufacturing processes, but these approaches are not valid for use in dynamic behavior environments. The goal of this paper is to present the process monitoring and adjustment methodologies for addressing dynamic behavior problems so that system performance improvement may be attained. The methodologies will provide a scientific approach to acquire critical knowledge of the dynamic behavior as well as improved control and quality, leading to the enhancement of economic position. The two major developments in this paper are: (1) the characterization of the dynamic behavior of the manufacturing process with the appropriate monitoring procedures; and (2) the development of adaptive monitoring procedures for the processes [for example, using trend charts (e.g., linear model) and time series charts (e.g., ARIMA models)] with a comparison between univariate and multivariate control charts. To provide a realistic environment for the development of the dynamic behavior monitoring and adjustment procedures, the cold rolling process is adopted as a test bed."

      "This study analyzes the quality attributes to online food delivery applications (OFD) that affect users' emotions and their continuous use intentions according to the pleasure-arousal-dominance and stimulus-organism-response theories. The study employs a mixed methods approach. The data processing and analysis of quantitative data were carried out using the covariance-based structural equation modeling method. We use content analysis to proceed the qualitative data. The results of this study indicated that the convenience quality attribute affected users' pleasure, arousal, and dominance, but the price information quality attribute only affected dominance, and the trustworthiness quality attribute do not affect any of the three user emotions. Furthermore, pleasure, arousal, and dominance affected intentions to continue using OFD. The limitation of this research is that respondents are dominated by respondents who live in urban areas. The results of this study are expected to provide theoretical contributions regarding the analysis of the quality attributes of OFD that affect the user's emotions on the user's continuous use intention of OFD. Finally, this study can assist OFD service providers in developing their applications."

      "This paper examines the wage returns to qualifications and academic disciplines in the Greek labour market. Exploring wage responsiveness across various degree subjects in Greece is interesting, as it is characterised by high levels of graduate unemployment, which vary considerably by field of study, and relatively low levels of wage flexibility. Using micro-data from recently available waves (2002-2003) of the Greek Labour Force Survey (LFS), the returns to academic disciplines are estimated by gender and public/private sector. Quantile regressions and cohort interactions are also used to capture the heterogeneity in wage returns across the various disciplines. The results show considerable variation in wage premiums across the fields of study, with lower returns for those that have a marginal role to play in an economy with a rising services/shrinking public sector. Educational reforms that pay closer attention to the future prospects of university disciplines are advocated."

Consistent with the \"active monitoring\" view, the results indicate that both domestic and foreign institutional investors have a positive effect on firm performance measured by Tobin's Q and Return on Asset (ROA). In addition, this study explores whether the other corporate governance attributes-board size and board independence-operate as mediators between institutional ownership and firm performance. Our findings indicate that both board size and board independence have a significant positive impact on the relationship between institutional ownership and firm performance."

      "We build a model to simulate how the euro area market-based financial system may function under stress. The core of the model is a set of representative agents re ecting key economic sectors, which interact in asset, funding, and derivatives markets and face solvency and liquidity constraints on their behaviour. We illustrate the model's behaviour in a twolayer approach. In Layer 1 the deterioration in the outlook for the corporate sector triggers portfolio reallocation by the model's agents. Layer 2 adds a rating downgrade shock where a fraction of investment grade corporate bonds is downgraded to high yield, which creates further rebalancing pressure and price movements. The model predicts (i) asset ows (buying and selling of marketable securities) across agents and (ii) balance sheet losses. It also provides quantitative evidence on equilibrium effects of the macroprudential regulation of nonbanks, which we illustrate by varying investment fund cash buffers.We identify the effect of climate change-related regulatory risks on credit real- location, Our evidence suggests that effects depend borrower's region, Following an increase in salience of regulatory risks, banks reallocate credit to US firms that could be negatively impacted by regulatory interventions, Conversely, in Europe, banks lend more to firms that could benefit from environmental regulation, The effect is moderated by banks' own loan portfolio composition, Banks with a portfolio tilted towards firms that could be negatively affected by environmental policies increasingly support these firms, Overall, our results indicate that financial impli- cations of regulation associated with climate change appear to be the main drivers of banks' behavior."

      "This paper analyzes a comprehensive data set of 108 non venture-backed, 58 venturebacked and 33 bridge financed companies going public at Germany's Neuer Markt between March 1997 and March 2000. I examine whether these three types of issues differ with regard to issuer characteristics, balance sheet data or offering characteristics. Moreover, this empirical study contributes to the underpricing literature by focusing on the complementary or rather competing role of venture capitalists and underwriters in certifying the quality of a company when going public. Companies backed by a prestigious venture capitalist and/or underwritten by a top bank are expected to show less underpricing at the initial public offering (IPO) due to a reduced ex-ante uncertainty. This study provides evidence to the contrary: VCbacked IPOs appear to be more underpriced than non VC-backed IPOs."

      "When attempting to measure gun ownership in the United States, the problem of missing administrative data arises, making it necessary to find a valid proxy. Several such proxies are employed in economic studies, one of which is the fraction of suicides by firearm of all suicides (FSS). My work validates this proxy from out-of-sample data, namely, Austrian administrative data on firearm licenses. I also reevaluate, with appropriate statistical methods, a result on firearms and suicide from the medical that is often used for public policy advocacy. This result is, unfortunately, heavily biased due to ignoring a well-known fallacy and thus can be only partially confirmed."

      "Green fiscal reforms would contribute to climate change mitigation, increase the economic efficiency of national tax systems and provide additional public revenues. Some countries in Latin America have already taken first steps towards green fiscal reforms. This paper provides an overview of the major challenges for the successful implementation of such reforms and discusses how they could be overcome. The authors first discuss the role of country-specific economic and political enabling conditions that need to be in place for successful implementation for green successful reforms. Second, they emphasize the importance of comprehensive reform plans that include all relevant ministries and agencies and are well-aligned with other policy objectives, such as energy security and industrial development. Third, they highlight how appropriate sequencing and gradualism could lower implementation costs and hence increase the political feasibility of green fiscal reforms. Finally, the authors analyze the potential impacts of green fiscal reforms on the distribution of income and discuss transfer schemes that could avoid adverse outcomes for the poorest parts of the population. They use these four dimensions to illustrate why recent reform efforts in selected Latin American countries have been successful or have failed, respectively."

      "Most ‘wage curve’ studies treat local labour markets as independent ‘islands’ in the national economy. However, when a local labour market is in close proximity of other labour markets, a local shock that increases unemployment may not lead to lower pay rates if employers fear outward migration of their workers. Hence, the unemployment elasticity of pay will be greater, the more isolated the local labour market is. Wages are also expected to be higher in regions that interact strongly with other regions. These hypotheses are confirmed by means of an estimation of wage curves with data for 327 regions of western Germany over the period 1990-97."

      "We analyze the short and long run effects of demographic ageing - increased longevity and reduced fertility - on per-capita growth. The OLG model captures direct effects, working through adjustments in the savings rate, labor supply, and capital deepening, and indirect effects, working through changes of taxes, government spending components and the retirement age in politico-economic equilibrium. Growth is driven by capital accumulation and productivity increases fueled by public investment. The closed-form solutions of the model predict taxation and the retirement age in OECD economies to increase in response to demographic ageing and per-capita growth to accelerate. If the retirement age were held constant, the growth rate in politico-economic equilibrium would essentially remain unchanged, due to a surge of social security transfers and crowding out of public investment."

      "This paper evaluates the potential welfare gains in the Mercosur region of South America as a benefit of improvement to the trade administrations. Improvements to border procedures and processes leading to border procedures can save billions of dollars for the region, create markets for exporters and enhance trade diversification for both imports and exports. Using a microeconomic model, we establish the benefit of improvement to trade administration processes by comparing the cost structures of Mercosur member states to two reference countries, Chile and Canada. We estimate that with recent trade figures, the region would benefit by in excess of USD 15 billion annually from reducing both the import and export sides of the trade administration costs to the level now enjoyed by these two reference countries."

    "abstract": [
      "The West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) was established by France to counteract the dominance of Anglophone countries in West Africa, particularly Nigeria and Ghana, over Francophone West Africa. Francophonie in French West Africa is mainly driven by a power elite, the 'Pré Quarré' in both France and Africa. The notorious Françafrique network determined the fate of the region for decades. This provoked a growing anti-French sentiment, which focused on three points. First, development policy; second, the currency; and third, the military. France was the only western country to maintain a significant military presence in the Sahel. While the number of French troops has fallen drastically from 30,000 in the early 1960s to around 6,100 today, political and military interventionism has not abated. But, after so many years of failed military efforts against terrorism in the region, citizens became increasingly suspicious of France's motives for being there. However, a clear distinction must be made between anti-French sentiment and anti-French military presence. Many believe that any presence of foreign troops in the Sahel makes the situation worse by attracting rather than repelling extremists. Yet, this view obscures two important realities. First, the development of a broader authoritarian movement, driven in part by Russia, that challenges democracy and its proponents. The local population makes France the scapegoat for the worsening of their situation on the ground. Its political leaders are capitalizing on hostility to the colonial legacy, including the CFA franc and military cooperation. This is fertile ground for insurgent military officials, who have no legal legitimacy but a thirst for authenticity. The slogan 'France, get out' has become a new means of legitimizing political and military power in French-speaking Africa. However, for some autocrats it is also used as a welcome distraction from acknowledging their own responsibility for the predicament. Africans are becoming increasingly aware that France is staying in Africa for its own interests. But anti-French is not necessarily pro-coup. The axis of young, fiery military leaders, seeking legitimacy from their terrorized compatriots, exploited all sorts of populist sentiments, from Africanism to the quest for economic independence. They accused Paris of supporting the terrorists who are targeting the local population so that France can continue siphoning off their resources and thereby sinking the country into increasing poverty. It would be a mistake to think that making it clear to Africans that they are being manipulated by the Russians would end the whole thing. Nevertheless, the African heavyweights of UEMOA, Côte d'Ivoire and Senegal, as well as the other member states, will keep the Union together out of self-interest, albeit on fairer terms. African public opinion is-understandably extremely sensitive to being treated as an equal. They don't want to be lectured to or made fun of.",
      "Die Westafrikanische Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion (UEMOA) wurde von Frankreich gegründet, um der Dominanz anglophoner Länder in Westafrika, insbesondere Nigeria und Ghana, über das französischsprachige Westafrika entgegenzuwirken. Die Frankophonie in Französisch-Westafrika wird hauptsächlich von einer Machtelite vorangetrieben, dem ‚Pré Quarré‘ in Frankreich und Afrika. Das berüchtigte Françafrique-Netzwerk bestimmte jahrzehntelang die Geschicke der Region. Dies löste eine wachsende antifranzösische Stimmung aus, die sich auf drei Punkte konzentrierte. Erstens, die Entwicklungspolitik; zweitens, die Währung; und drittens, das Militär. Frankreich war das einzige westliche Land, das eine bedeutende militärische Präsenz in der Sahelzone aufrecht erhielt. Während die Zahl der französischen Truppen von 30.000 in den frühen 1960er Jahren drastisch auf heute etwa 6.100 gesunken ist, hat der politische und militärische Interventionismus nicht nachgelassen. Doch nach so vielen Jahren gescheiterter militärischer Bemühungen gegen den Terrorismus in der Region wurden die Bürger zunehmend misstrauisch gegenüber den Motiven Frankreichs für seinen Aufenthalt dort. Es muss jedoch klar zwischen antifranzösischer Stimmung und antifranzösischer Militärpräsenz unterschieden werden. Viele glauben, dass jede Präsenz ausländischer Truppen in der Sahelzone die Situation verschlimmert, indem sie Extremisten anzieht und nicht abwehrt. Diese Sichtweise verdeckt jedoch zwei wichtige Realitäten. Erstens die Entwicklung einer breiteren autoritären Bewegung, die teilweise von Russland vorangetrieben wird und die Demokratie und ihre Befürworter herausfordert. Die lokale Bevölkerung macht Frankreich zum Sündenbock für die Verschlechterung ihrer Lage vor Ort. Seine politischen Führer nutzen die Feindseligkeit gegenüber dem kolonialen Erbe, einschließlich des CFA-Franc, und der militärischen Zusammenarbeit. Dies ist ein fruchtbarer Boden für rebellierende Militärs, die keine rechtliche Legitimität, dafür aber nach Authentizität dürsten. Der Slogan „Frankreich, raus“ ist zu einem neuen Mittel der Legitimierung politischer und militärischer Macht im frankophonen Afrika geworden. Für einige Autokraten dient es jedoch auch als willkommene Ablenkung von der Anerkennung ihrer eigenen Verantwortung für die missliche Lage. Den Afrikanern wird zunehmend bewusst, dass Frankreich aus eigenen Interessen in Afrika bleibt. Aber Anti-Französisch ist nicht unbedingt Pro-Putsch. Die Achse der jungen, heißspornigen Militärführer, die von ihren terrorisierten Landsleuten Legitimität suchen, nutzte alle möglichen populistischen Gefühle aus, vom Afrikanismus bis zum Streben nach wirtschaftlicher Unabhängigkeit. Sie warfen Paris vor, die Terroristen zu unterstützen, die es auf die lokale Bevölkerung abgesehen haben, damit Frankreich weiterhin ihre Ressourcen abschöpfen und das Land dadurch in zunehmende Armut stürzen kann. Es wäre ein Fehler zu glauben, dass die ganze Sache zu Ende wäre, wenn den Afrikanern klar gemacht würde, dass sie von den Russen manipuliert werden. Dennoch werden die afrikanischen Schwergewichte UEMOA, Côte d'Ivoire und Senegal sowie die anderen Mitgliedstaaten die Union aus Eigeninteresse zusammenhalten, wenn auch zu faireren Bedingungen. Die afrikanische öffentliche Meinung reagiert verständlicherweise äußerst empfindlich darauf, gleichberechtigt behandelt zu werden. Sie wollen nicht belehrt oder ausgelacht werden."

      "The cost-effectiveness of unilateral emission abatement can be seriously hampered by emission leakage. We assess three widely-discussed proposals for leakage reduction targeted at energy-intensive and trade-exposed industries: border tax adjustments, output-based allocation and industry exemptions. We find that none of these measures amounts to a \"magic bullet\" when both efficiency and equity criteria matter. Border tax adjustments reduce leakage and provide global cost savings but exacerbate regional inequality. Exemptions produce very little leakage reduction and run the risk of increasing efficiency cost of climate policy. Output-based allocation does no harm but also does relatively little good by our outcome measures."

      "A board with high equality is expected to play a significant role in corporate governance. This study aims to examine the influence of impactful women directors on constraining the level of earnings management (EM). Impactful women director is a new concept examined by the study, where women directors on board must be serving in the audit committee (AC). Having women on the board who also serves on the AC will strengthen the role and power of women directors in mitigating EM. The study covers companies with the lowest positive return on assets. Based on the regression, the results of the study seem to be in line with the theories of agency and resource dependence. There is a significant negative relationship between the impactful women directors and the level of EM, accrual, and real earnings management. Having at least one female director who also serves on the AC enhances the effectiveness of the board and then, significantly constrains EM. Likewise, having at least two female directors and at least one of them serving on the AC could improve their participation in decision-making and effectively monitor the managers' behavior toward engaging in EM. The study is very useful for policymakers, stakeholders, researchers, and society. Firms should appoint more women directors on board and at the same time appoint at least one of them at the AC to strengthen their role in monitoring and supervising the management."

      "The role of farm size has recently come to the forefront of agricultural development debates. Agricultural development policy often focuses on small farms given evidence of their role in poverty reduction and of higher yields. Yet policy has also focused on large farms due to their share of output, efficiency gains from vertical and horizontal integration, and potential employment generation. Brazil offers an interesting case study because of its wide spectrum of farm sizes and the country's dual agricultural policy focus towards large commercial agribusiness enterprises, led by the Ministry of Agriculture, and family farms, led by the Ministry of Agrarian Development. Our purpose is to examine the role that farm size may have in Brazil's agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) growth, which has accelerated at one of the world's fastest rates over the last twenty years. The data are drawn from the agricultural censuses of 1985, 1995-96, and 2006, aggregated at the municipality level into five farm-size classes. The findings of this study point to heavy technical efficiency losses across all size classes, creating a substantial drag on national agricultural TFP growth. Moreover, because farms in the middle of the size distribution achieved the slowest technical change and TFP growth bookended by faster growth in the smallest and largest farm-size classes we identify an unexpected and unexplored source of inefficiency, namely medium-sized farms."

      "Fund families strategically shape their member funds' behavior to target specific groups of investors with varying performance and service needs. In this paper I introduce a new measure to identify performance-oriented and service-oriented funds. Matching theories from the industrial organization literature, I suggest that funds whose families outsource the execution of services unrelated to portfolio management to external specialists are the same funds with an emphasis on their core business portfolio management. I find an outperformance of serviceoutsourced funds that is robust to a range of alternative explanations. Moreover, I show evidence that service-outsourced funds indeed possess superior investment skills."

      "Starting from December 2012, insurers in the European Union were prohibited from charging gender-discriminatory prices. We examine the effect of this unisex mandate on risk segmentation in the German health insurance market. Although gender used to be a pricing factor in Germany's private health insurance (PHI) sector, it was never used as a pricing factor in the social health insurance (SHI) sector. The unisex mandate makes PHI relatively more attractive for women and less attractive for men. Based on data from the German socio-economic panel, we analyze how the unisex mandate affects the difference between women and men in switching rates between SHI and PHI. We find that the unisex mandate increases the probability of switching from SHI to PHI for women relative to men. On the other hand, the unisex mandate has no effect on the gender difference in switching rates from PHI to SHI. Because women have on average higher health care expenditures than men, our results imply a worsening of the PHI risk pool and an improvement of the SHI risk pool. Our results demonstrate that regulatory measures such as the unisex mandate can affect risk selection between public and private health insurance sectors."

      "This paper examines how the shift towards working from home during and after the Covid-19 pandemic shapes the way how labor market and locality choices interact. For our analysis, we combine large administrative data on employment biographies in Germany and a new working from home potential indicator based on comprehensive data on working conditions across occupations. We find that in the wake of the Covid&#x2011;19 pandemic, the distance between workplace and residence has increased more strongly for workers in occupations that can be done from home: The association of working from home potential and work-home distance increased significantly since 2021 as compared to a stable pattern before. The effect is much larger for new jobs, suggesting that people match to jobs with high working from home potential that are further away than before the pandemic. Most of this effect stems from jobs in big cities, which indicates that working from home alleviates constraints by tight housing markets. We find no significant evidence that commuting patterns changed more strongly for women than for men.",
      "Wir untersuchen, wie die verstärkte Nutzung von Homeoffice während und nach der Covid-19-Pandemie die Art und Weise beeinflusst, wie der Arbeitsmarkt und die Wahl von Wohn- und Arbeitsort interagieren. Für unsere Analyse kombinieren wir Individualdaten zu Erwerbsbiografien in Deutschland und einen neuen Homeoffice-Potenzialindikator, der auf umfassenden Daten zu berufsspezifischen Arbeitsbedingungen basiert. Wir stellen fest, dass sich im Zuge der Covid-19-Pandemie Arbeitsplatz und Wohnort von Beschäftigten in Berufen, die von zu Hause aus ausgeübt werden können, weiter entfernt haben: Der Zusammenhang zwischen Homeoffice-Potenzial und Entfernung zwischen Arbeitsplatz und Wohnort hat seit 2021 stetig zugenommen. Zuvor war der Zusammenhang über einen längeren Zeitraum stabil. Der Effekt ist für neue Arbeitsplätze im Vergleich zu bestehenden Arbeitsplätzen sehr viel größer. Im Vergleich zur Zeit vor der Pandemie, sind Jobs mit hohem Homeoffice-Potenzial im Durchschnitt weiter entfernt von den Wohnorten der Beschäftigten, die in diese Jobs gewechselt haben. Der größere Teil dieses Effekts ist auf Arbeitsplätze in Großstädten zurückzuführen, was darauf hindeutet, dass die Arbeit von zu Hause aus die Einschränkungen durch angespannte Wohnungsmärkte mildert. Wir finden dabei keine signifikanten Hinweise darauf, dass sich Pendelgewohnheiten bei Frauen oder Männern stärker verändert haben."

      "Using the 2006 Census, we create a continuous index that quantifies the relatedness between 1375 fields of study and 520 occupations for native-born workers and use it as the benchmark reflecting the \"common\" matching quality in Canadian labor markets that internationally educated immigrant workers could achieve in the long run. This allows us to approximate the cost of the occupational mismatch of immigrants by estimating the change in their earnings had they been distributed identically to the native born in terms of relatedness. Although the results show a significant and persistent poor matching quality for foreign-educated immigrants, their relative underutilization cost is negligible."

    "abstract": [
      "The stubbornly low and declining level of labor force participation rate (LFPR) of Indian women has prompted a great deal of attention with a focus on factors constraining women's labour supply. Using 12 rounds of a high frequency household panel survey, we demonstrate volatility in Indian women's labour market engagement, as they exit and (re)enter the labor force multiple times over short period for reasons unrelated to marriage, child-birth, or change in household income. We demonstrate how these frequent transitions exacerbate the issue of measurement of female LFPR. Women elsewhere in the world face a \"motherhood penalty\" in the form of adverse labour market outcomes after the first childbirth. We evaluate the motherhood penalty in the Indian context and find that mothers with new children have a lower base level of LFPR, but there is no sharp decline around the time of childbirth. Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition of determinants of female LFPR suggests that none of the total fall (10 percentage points) in our study period is explained by a change in supply-side demographic characteristics. We suggest that frequent transitions, as well as fall in LFPR, are consistent with the demand-side constraints, viz., that women's participation is falling due unavailability of steady gainful employment. The high unemployment rate and industry-wise composition of total employment provide suggestive evidence that women's participation is falling as women are likely to be displaced from employment by male workers. We show that women's employment is likely to suffer more than men's due to negative economic shocks, as was seen during the fallout of demonetisation of 86 percent of Indian currency in 2016. Our analysis contests the prominent narrative that women are voluntarily dropping out of the labor force due to an increase in household income and conservative social norms. Our results suggest that India needs to focus more on creating jobs for women to retain them in the labor force."

Contrary to expectations, the regional unemployment rates for natives and immigrants are not statistically associated with a higher or lower probability of expressing anti-immigration attitudes. Furthermore, findings sug- gest that native respondents are more likely to support immigration restriction of those from poorer countries regardless of whether they are European or not and irrespective of ethnicity."

      "The interpretation and measurement of the innovation performance of territorial units represent well established research areas. Nevertheless the way this issue is usually addressed raises several questions. In present paper we are dealing with two of these problematic fields: the level of territorial aggregation of the analysis and the aspect from which innovation performance is judged (considered to be effective or desirable). Innovation is certainly a spatial phenomenon. In addition to that it is very much a local phenomenon, which is argued by many regional scientists. In order to reflect to these characters - beyond national or regional analyses - subregional (local) examinations are desired. However empirical analyses hardly go beyond the regional level. Beside the question of \"where\", the question of \"what\" seems to be even more problematic and neglected. The innovation performance of a territorial unit can be interpreted as the effectiveness of the system of innovation. This approach inevitably has a subjective element: the ex ante definition of effectiveness. In the literature the aspect from which effectiveness is judged is characteristically the ability to contribute to economic growth or the ability to speed-up technological change. When considering technological change a complex (socio-ecological) phenomenon this point of view seems to be inadequate, or at least accidental. Therefore we provide an empirical analysis which is carried out at subregional level, and attempts to link territorial innovation performance to the well-being of local residents. Both theoretical and methodological challenges emerge when trying to interpret and measure well-being and innovation performance at this very low level of territorial aggregation. Present paper aims to be a small step in contributing to handle these challenges."

      "The aim of the paper is the analysis of the household use of durables in Poland and other European countries. Relatively, the highest amount of money for household furnishing with durables was spent by the Bulgarians and the Italians (more than 7% of the total household expenses). In Poland, the highest expenditure occurred for the wealthiest households and those where the head of the household had a university degree while the least money was spent in numerous-family households. The best equipped households (quantity wise) were such that had one or two children and those where the household head had a university degree. The cluster analysis allowed distinguishing household groups of similar durables ownership level. These groups may be treated as consumer segments. The presented analyses also indicate the trends of the Polish consumers regarding the possession of durables."

      "In order to facilitate the use of biodiversity indicators in policy making at the country level, a few and well-established indices should be suggested. Promising candidates include biodiversity-related indices of the Convention on Biological Diversity; therefore I evaluate their current use and performance in Hungary as a model country. Especially indices of the ecosystem level have already been in use, but they are not necessarily useful measures of the state of biodiversity in their current form. I recommend some improvements which may potentially increase their applicability. First, as not all the ecosystems suggested globally for monitoring (forests and marine habitats) are present in all the countries, the way of ecosystem selection should be standardized not the actual ecosystem types. Besides the information on the extent of some selected habitats, the original cover should also be considered to evaluate the present situation. In case of species-based indicators, the overlap between indices (e.g. involvement of birds in all of them) should be reduced. In the long run ecosystem-based indicators that account for ecosystem processes should be used in policy making instead of static lists as not biodiversity per se is important but the related ecosystem services."

      "This study examines the impact of the interactions of audit litigation and ownership structure on audit quality by Big 4 and non-Big 4 audit firms in Oman. This study uses modified audit opinion as proxies for audit quality, binary variable for audit litigation and percentage of shares owned by large shareholders and minority shareholders (consisting of Arab [non-GCC] shareholders) for ownership structure. The study uses size, risk, types of activity and ages of the firms as control variables. For the analysis and explanation of results descriptive statistics, correlation, regression techniques and T-test are used. Based on a sample of 107 listed companies on Muscat Securities Market (MSM) for 2013-2017, we find that audit litigation has a significant impact on audit quality for Big 4 audit firms, but not for non-Big 4 audit firms. Also, the results indicate that there is no difference between Big 4 and non-Big 4 audit firms as far as litigation risk is concerned."

      "This paper describes EUROLAB, a labour supply-demand microsimulation model that relies on EUROMOD, the static microsimulation model for the European Union countries. EUROLAB is built on a multidimensional discrete choice model of labour supply and accounts for involuntary unemployment. The model estimates individual changes in supplied hours of work and participation as a reaction to a hypothetical or real taxtransfer reform, often referred to in the literature as \"second-order\" effects. Furthermore, the model allows for the demand-side effects of a labour market that, depending on how elastic it is, would lead to a different labour supply when the market reaches its equilibrium. The model is unique in covering 27 countries under the same specification of preferences, opportunity set representation and the same concept of income and working hours. We illustrate the usefulness of the model by showing several examples of EUROLAB, using both the one-dimensional and multidimensional versions. Potential extensions of the model are also discussed in the paper."

In order to examine how FDI and entrepreneurship policy in these two regions might have influenced the levels of knowledge-based entrepreneurship, we outline FDI and entrepreneurship policies for Wales and Ireland and key measures of knowledge creation, and evaluate the extent and nature of FDI activity and its relationship with entrepreneurship in general and knowledge-based entrepreneurship in particular. Implications include possible policy di-rections for countries that are characterized by weak knowledge-creating institutions yet wish to encourage knowledge-based entrepreneurship."

      "This paper studies how national sentiment in the form of either a perception or a loyalty bias of bettors may affect pricing patterns on national wagering markets for international sport events. We show theoretically that both biases can be profitably exploited by bookmakers by way of price adjustment (odds shading). The former bias induces bookmakers to shade odds against the domestic team, the latter to adjust them in a way that depends on the demand elasticity of bettors for their national favorite. Analyzing empirically a unique data set of betting quotas from online bookmakers in twelve European countries for qualification games to the UEFA Euro 2008, we find evidence for systematic biases in the pricing of own national teams in the odds for win offered across countries. Variations in the sign and magnitude of these deviations can be explained by differences across countries in the respective strengths of the perception and loyalty biases among domestic bettors."

      "We study whether employment history can provide information about a worker's non-cognitive skills - in particular, about \"work attitude\", or the ability to work well and cooperatively with others. We conjecture that, holding all else equal, a worker's frequent job changes can indicate poorer work attitude, and that this information is transmitted in labor markets through employment histories. We provide support for this hypothesis across three studies that employ complementary lab, field, and survey experiments. First, a laboratory labor market, in which the only valuable characteristic of workers is their reliability in cooperating with an employer's effort requests, demonstrates that prior employment information allows employers to screen for such reliability and allows high-reliability workers to obtain better employment outcomes. Second, we conduct a field experiment that varies the frequency of job changes in fictitious job applicants' resumes. Those applicants with fewer job changes receive substantially more callbacks from prospective employers. Finally, a survey experiment with human resource professionals confirms that the resume manipulations in the field study create different perceptions of work attitude and that these account for the callback differences. Our work highlights the potential importance of job history as a signal of worker characteristics, and points to a cost for workers of frequent job changes."

      "This paper takes a closer look at the supposed mechanisms behind German welfare state resilience, which are given in mainstream institutionalist theories. I focus on reform hurdles associated with the make-up of the German welfare state, both at the macro-level (principles) as well as at the meso-level (programmes), exposing systematically mechanisms of path-dependence and other sources of policy stickiness. In addition, I zoom in on the political- institutional sources of resilience. This survey of institutional reform obstacles is complemented by a review of reform pressures and policy developments in the main social policy areas, old age pensions, health care, and unemployment policy between 1975 and 2004. The main conclusion is that despite numerous sources of pressure for far-reaching welfare state reform, the various mechanisms of resilience have made for a pattern of incremental reform, although a number of structural reforms have occurred fairly recently.",
      "Dieses Arbeitspapier befasst sich mit den Mechanismen, die gemäß institutionellen Wohlfahrtstaatstheorien die Reformresistenz des deutschen Sozialstaats erklären sollen. Es richtet sich dabei auf Reformhindernisse, die auf der institutionellen Struktur des Wohlfahrtsstaats beruhen, sowohl auf Makroniveau (sozialstaatliche Prinzipien) als auch auf Mesoniveau (Teilbereiche). Dabei legt es systematisch dar, wo sich tatsächlich Pfadabhängigkeiten und andere Ursachen von Veränderungsresistenz verbergen. Darüber hinaus wird auf die politisch-institutionellen Quellen der Reformresistenz eingegangen. Die Analyse wird ergänzt durch eine Besprechung der Ursachen des wachsenden Reformdrucks und einer Übersicht der Policy-Entwicklung der letzten 30 Jahre in den Teilbereichen Rente, Arbeitslosenversicherung und Gesundheitspolitik. Das Papier kommt zu dem Schluss, dass trotz des erheblichen Reformdrucks die zahlreichen Resistenzmechanismen ein Muster inkrementeller Veränderungen zur Folge hatten und dieses erst in den letzten Jahren durch eine Reihe von Strukturreformen unterbrochen wurde."

Es wird analysiert, welche \"kritischen Massen\" in der Grenzregion mobilisiert werden könnten, um auf beiden Seiten der Grenze Schwächen zu überwinden und die Gesamtregion im Wettbewerb um Investoren und knappe Arbeitskräfte zu stärken. Auf Grundlage einer Expertenbefragung werden Schlüsselfaktoren für die Entwicklung der Grenzregion abgeleitet und mögliche Entwicklungsszenarien für die deutsch-dänische Grenzregion modelliert. Das Autorenteam zeigt darüber hinaus, dass die Erfahrungen und Kooperationsmodelle bereits stärker integrierten Grenzregionen Lerneffekte für die Institutionalisierung der Zusammenarbeit und insbesondere für die Ausgestaltung von Arbeitsmarktkooperationen bieten.",
      "The study identifies economic strengths and weaknesses on both sides of the German-Danish border as well as fields of action for deeper cooperation in the border region. It analyzes which \"critical masses\" could be mobilized in the border region to overcome weaknesses on both sides of the border and to strengthen the overall region in the competition for investors and scarce labor. Based on an expert survey, key factors for the development of the border region are derived and possible development scenarios for the German-Danish border region are modeled. The team of authors also shows that the experiences and cooperation models of already more integrated border regions offer learning effects for the institutionalization of cooperation and especially for the design of labor market cooperation."

      "Die zunehmende Ungleichheit von Einkommen und Vermögen wird in Europa intensiv diskutiert. Obwohl es für die Gestaltung von Sozialpolitik eine große Rolle spielt, ob Ungleichheiten als gerecht oder ungerecht angesehen werden, ist bisher wenig erforscht, wie BürgerInnen diese Ungleichheiten im Einzelnen bewerten. Um diese Lücke zu schließen, werden die Antwortprofile untersucht, die den Gerechtigkeitsbewertungen von Einkommen und Vermögen im European Social Survey (2018/2019) zugrunde liegen. Unter europäischen Erwerbstätigen werden vier solcher Gerechtigkeitsprofile identifiziert: Die Profile KritikerInnen, AltruistInnen, Benachteiligte und Status-quo-BefürworterInnen unterscheiden sich in Bezug darauf, ob und wo in der Einkommens- und Vermögensverteilung sie Ungerechtigkeiten feststellen. Die meisten Befragten gehören entweder zu den KritikerInnen, die Ungerechtigkeiten in allen Bereichen feststellen und Umverteilung befürworten, oder zu den AltruistInnen, die ihre eigene Situation als gerecht, die gesellschaftlichen Einkommens- und Vermögensunterschiede jedoch als ungerecht bewerten. Die weit verbreitete Sorge um soziale Gerechtigkeit sollte politisch aufgegriffen werden. Bei der Gestaltung länderspezifischer politischer Maßnahmen sollte jedoch berücksichtigt werden, wo in der Vermögens- und Einkommensverteilung Ungerechtigkeiten identifiziert werden."

      "We study the role of face-to-face interaction for gender differences in deceptive behavior and perceived honesty. In the first part, we compare women to men's deceptive behavior using data from an incentivized income-reporting experiment with three treatments. Reporting is fully computerized in a baseline treatment but occurs face-to-face in the second and third treatment. Lies can be detected in the course of an audit, which happens with a given probability in the first and second treatment whereas it depends on perceptions by others in the third treatment. In the computerized baseline treatment, men and women's deceptive behavior is statistically indistinguishable. However, women's truthfulness increases when face-to-face interaction is introduced in the second treatment. In contrast, males' deceptive behavior does not change until the audit probability depends on their perceived honesty in the third treatment. Then, men's truthfulness rises sharply and exceeds women's level of honesty by far. We elaborate on these gender differences in the second part. We conduct an experiment to assess the honesty of videotaped income-reporting statements from a setting identical to the third treatment. Our findings confirm that men anticipate their low perceived honesty, which is consistent with the results from the first part."

This case study-based research provides evidence of various macro-environmental and individual drivers of a grassroots entrepreneurial process, contextualised in Korea's sporting culture. Macro-environmental factors include the economic crisis and Korean cultural values of comradery, emotional expressiveness and entrepreneurial spirit. At the individual level, self-leadership, focus, persistence, team dynamics and access to resources explain the growth of ultrarunning and the commitment to hosting the IAU World Cup. Implications for sports entrepreneurship and grassroots-initiated mega-sporting events in Asia are discussed."

      "Die Bedeutung des Wirtschaftsfaktors Wissen, sowohl als Produktionsfaktor als auch als Produkt und ökonomisch handelbares Gut, nimmt immer weiter zu, sodass von einem Übergang zur Wissensökonomie gesprochen werden kann. Unter der Annahme, dass die Wirtschaftsentwicklung künftig eine auf Wissen basierte Entwicklung ist, wird auch die räumliche Entwicklung von den Besonderheiten dieses Faktors bestimmt: Wissen ist kumulativ, Wissen ist an Personen gebunden, Wissen ist ein öffentliches Gut und beim Handel mit Wissensgütern bestehen große Informationsasymmetrien. Diese vier besonderen Eigenschaften von Wissen bewirken für sich genommen und in der Summe eine zunehmende räumliche Konzentration ökonomischer Aktivität. Das bedeutet, dass die bereits heute bestehenden räumlichen Ungleichheiten weiter zunehmen werden. Im Vorteil sind in der Folge solche Regionen, die bereits heute in der Lage sind, hochwertige Produkte und Dienstleistungen anzubieten.",
      "Knowledge as an economic factor gets more and more important. It increasingly serves as a production factor as well as a product and economic good itself and thus a transition to a knowledge economy can be observed. Assuming that economic development therefore is increasingly a knowledge-based development, the spatial development will also be affected by the characteristics of this factor: Knowledge is cumulative, knowledge is personal and a public good at the same time; plus a market of knowledge goods is strongly restricted because of information asymmetries. These four characteristics imply a spatial concentration of economic activity, which means that future spatial disparities are based on today's dispersion of economic activity. That gives an advantage to regions with already available resources like skilled workers that are able to deliver high-quality products and services."

      "We use new population-wide register data on inheritances and wealth in Sweden to estimate the causal impact of inheritances on wealth inequality. We find that inheritances reduce relative wealth inequality (e.g., the Gini coefficient falls by 5-10 percent) but that absolute dispersion increases. Examining different parts of the wealth distribution, we find that the top decile's wealth share decreases substantially, whereas the wealth share of the bottom half increases from a negative to a positive share. In essence, wealthier heirs inherit larger amounts, but less wealthy heirs inherit more relative to their preinheritance wealth. We also find that post-inheritance behavioral adjustments mitigate the equalizing effect of inheritances because less wealthy heirs consume larger shares of their inheritances. Moreover, we find that the Swedish inheritance tax reduced the equalizing inheritance effect but that the redistribution of tax revenues could reverse this result. Finally, we show that inheritances increase wealth mobility."

      "I present a structural econometric analysis supporting the hypothesis that money is still relevant for shaping inflation and output dynamics in the United States. In particular, I find that real money balance effects are quantitatively important, although smaller than they used to be in the early postwar period. Moreover, I show three additional implications of the econometric estimates for monetary policy analysis. First, by including real money balance effects into the standard sticky price model, two stylized facts can be explained: the modestly procyclical real wage response to a monetary policy shock and the supply side effects of monetary policy. Second, the existence of real money balance effects causes higher volatility of output and lower volatility of interest rates under the optimal monetary policy. Third, the reduction in the size of real money balance effects can account for a significant decline in macroeconomic volatility."

      "This paper investigates the reservation wages of unemployed persons on the basis of a job-search model with non-static reservation wages using panel data from Germany from 1987 to 1998. The results suggest that reservation wages are relatively high in Germany compared to other countries. Furthermore, pooled regression results show that most recent wages and personal characteristics of the unemployed are the most important determinants of reservation wages. In contrast neither unemployment duration nor different kinds of unemployment benefits influence reservation wages. Hence the findings corroborate the hypothesis that unemployed persons are not subject to strong financial pressure and thus have no significant motivation to find a new job."

      "This work provides an update of changes in the income distribution over the period from 1998-2004, using data from the Household Labour Force Survey's annual Income Supplement (HLFS-IS). We focus on changes in working-age individuals' earnings and total income distribution and, to allow for resource sharing within households, their equivalised household total income distribution over the period. Our analysis shows that there have been broad gains in income to both individuals and households, suggesting the spoils of growth have been shared widely across the income distribution. Mean and median earnings increased 15 percent and 23 percent respectively, while mean and median individual income both increased 12-13 percent and equivalised household income by 11 percent. Inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, was more stable: individual earnings inequality fell 4 percent; individual income inequality was unchanged, while equivalised household income inequality increased 2-3 percent. The main contributors to the observed changes appear to be employment and real wage growth. We estimate that roughly one-half of the growth in average individual incomes is due to employment growth, and one-quarter each to demographic changes and wage growth. We also find that the relative employment and wage contributions have varied across the distribution: income gains at the lower end of the income distributions have been largely driven by employment, while changes at the higher end have been driven by wage gains."

      "We study the impact of private information on volatility in financial markets. We develop a comprehensive framework to investigate this link while controlling for the effects of both public information (such as macroeconomic news releases) and private information on prices and the effects of public information on volatility. Using a high-frequency 30-year U.S. Treasury bond futures data set, we find that private information variables, such as order flow and bid-ask spread, are statistically and economically significant explanatory variables for volatility. Private information is more important than public information, with the effect of a shock to order flow on volatility being four times larger than the effect of a surprise in the most influential macroeconomic news announcement. Moreover, we document an interaction between public and private information effects on volatility, with the impact of order flow on volatility depending positively on the dispersion of analysts' expectations about macroeconomic announcements. Finally, we find that the effect of private information on volatility is larger during contractions than during expansions."

      "This paper provides an empirical analysis how tariff diversity affects fixed-line broadband uptake, utilizing a new data set with 1497 fixed-line and 2158 mobile broadband tariffs from 91 countries across the globe. An instrumental variable approach is applied to estimate demand, controlling for various industry and socio-economic factors. The empirical results indicate that, firstly, lower prices, more tariff diversity and higher income increase broadband penetration. Secondly, inter-platform competition and mobile broadband prices are not found to have a significant effect on fixed-line broadband penetration. This suggests that low prices and the diversity of broadband offerings are more important drivers of fixed broadband adoption than competition between various technologies (cable networks, fixed-line telephone networks, mobile networks)."

      "Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) accord a special attention to the integration of the least developed countries (LDCs) into the global trading system. A major Decision in favour of LDCs adopted by WTO Trade Ministers was the one concerning the Duty-Free-Quota-Free (DFQF) market access for products originating in LDCs. The Decision requests that developed-country Members, and developing-country Members in a position to do so, to provide DFQF market access for at least 97% of products originating from LDCs. The present paper investigates whether the DFQF market access schemes offered by the Quadrilateral (i.e., Canada, the European Union, Japan and the United States) to LDCs have helped reduce the volatility of the utilization rates of these generous preferences. The theoretical hypothesis tested is that the minimum target of '97%' and the unlimited duration of the schemes (as long as beneficiaries do not lose the LDC status) have increased the market access predictability as well as the potential benefits of the schemes for LDCs' trading firms, and could hence result in a lower volatility of LDCs' utilization of these schemes. To perform the analysis, we compare LDCs' performance in terms of the volatility of the utilization rate of the DFQF market access schemes with the performance of other designated LICs by the International Monetary Fund, that did not the benefits of the DFQF schemes, and whose products enjoyed less generous preferential treatment. The comparison of the performance of these two groups was made over the period from 2014 to 2019 versus the period from 2004 to 2013. Results have lent credence to the theoretical hypothesis by revealing that the DFQF market access initiative has genuinely been instrumental in reducing the volatility of the utilization rate of these generous preferences schemes in LDCs. The policy implications of the analysis are discussed."

      "Ethiopia has experienced rapid economic growth since 2005. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average rate of 10.5 per cent per annum for the period between 2004-05 and 2013-14. Public investment in key infrastructure and interventions in the agriculture sector have made important contributions to GDP growth. This growth has been accompanied by a process of capital deepening and signs of structural shift away from traditional and primary sectors towards secondary and tertiary sectors. Both processes of high growth and structural shift have important implications for poverty reduction and income distribution. One potential channel through which these influences work is the labour market. The indications of structural transformation that Ethiopia has shown in the last decade, including a continuous decline in the role of agriculture and rise in that of services, have led to reallocation of jobs and labour from low-productivity agriculture to more productive industrial - in particular the construction sub-sector - and service sectors. The rise in total factor productivity, overall increase in labour force participation rate, and fall in the labour share of the agriculture sector are indicative of the nature and extent of structural shift in the Ethiopian economy. A more durable shift of economic activities towards the manufacturing sector is expected to follow the rising trend in investment in the sector. This study explores the impact of the high economic growth and slow but unmistakable structural change on a number of economic outcomes working through the labour market. The growth opportunities and challenges of the Ethiopian economy are also discussed."

      "Familienunternehmen sind genau so innovativ wie Nicht-Familienunternehmen. Systematische Unterschiede gibt es jedoch in Hinblick auf die Innovationstreiber: Ein solcher ist die Unternehmensgröße. So hat sich gezeigt, dass kleinere Familienunternehmen verhältnismäßig große Innovationsvorteile aufweisen. Die Studie liefert auch Hinweise dafür, dass insbesondere ältere Familienunternehmen eine höhere Anzahl von FuE-Kooperationen eingehen. Zudem verkleinern Familienunternehmen seltener ihren Personalbestand. Dies wirkt sich ebenfalls positiv auf ihr Innovationsverhalten aus. Allerdings gibt es auch Faktoren, die das Innovationsverhalten von Familienunternehmen negativ beeinflussen: So zeigt sich, dass die Innovationsneigung in der Gründergeneration am höchsten ist, aber mit jeder nachfolgenden Generation signifikant abnimmt - zum Teil unter das Niveau von Nicht-Familienunternehmen.",
      "Prior findings are inconclusive concerning the innovation activities of family SMEs when compared to non-family counterparts. This study overcomes these shortcomings by analyzing specific determinants influencing the innovation output of family SMEs. Using data of 1.870 SMEs located in Germany, we argue that the main characteristic of family SMEs is the unity of ownership and leadership when compared their non-family counterparts. Deriving a set of hypotheses from this assumption, we find that local embeddedness, long-term orientation and effective corporate governance structures positively affect the ability to generate product and process innovations family firms. We can show, for example, that older family firms conduct more research and development activities with partners due to emergent regional networks. We also find that the innovation output continuously falls from generation to generation."

      "After decades of steady liberalisation and financial market development, emerging capital markets experienced unparalleled capital inflows in the aftermath of the emerging markets crisis in the 1990s. This paper studies portfolio investment decisions of German banks in 30 emerging capital markets using monthly data from 2002 to 2007. The use of a dynamic Time-Series Cross-Section framework and the micro database External Position Report provided by Deutsche Bundesbank, which covers German banks assets and liability positions vis-à-vis foreign countries, allows insights into the various determinants: indicators of financial market development, the portfolio-calculus of investors, investor-specific characteristics, as well as the macroeconomic environment. There is evidence for German banks taking into account the various dimensions of financial market development in their portfolio investment decisions and anticipating the special risks inherent in emerging markets. The implication for policymakers would be to foster financial market development in order to attract and sustain international portfolio investors. However, there is additional evidence for the investor's domestic market environment and global risk aversion exerting a significant influence in times of financial turmoil."

      "The paper examines the relation between Vietnam Airline domestic service quality and customer satisfaction by gathering opinions from 402 passengers employing the Skytrax scale with some modification along with Cronbach's alpha, exploratory factor analysis, and multiple regression analysis. Results show that Vietnam Airline domestic service quality can be measured by the following six determinants in order of decreasing importance: (1) boarding/deplaning/baggage, (2) check-in, (3) in-flight services, (4) reservation, (5) aircraft, and (6) flight crew. All of them have directly proportional effects to customer satisfaction. The paper also offers some suggestions to improve the service quality, thereby enhancing the customer satisfaction."

      "The paper uses a unique survey of recruitment firms to look at how Russian firms perceive the supply of skills in the labour market and how well those skills match to their demand for labour. Firms invest significant amounts of time in search to fill vacancies and search time is unambiguously increasing in skills. These skill gaps are associated with significant wage premia and are perceived to have negative consequences for the output mix and productivity. A small job postings experiment also finds that search time increased yet further for activities considered relatively innovative. Further, using Russian Ministry of Labour data for all legal migrant applications in 2010 and matching the migrant to the sponsoring firm, we find that there is some - albeit limited - evidence of firms using migrants to address high skill shortages. However, the overwhelming majority of migrants are skilled or unskilled workers; a reflection of the low underlying rates of innovation and associated demand for high skill jobs."

      "Nach den Ergebnissen des jüngsten ifo Innovationstests realisierten in den letzten Jahren zwar über die Hälfte der Unternehmen Produkt- und/oder Prozessinnovationen, aber 2001 war erstmals ein merklicher Rückgang der Innovationsaktivitäten festzustellen. Gemessen an der Zahl der Unternehmen fiel der Innovatorenanteil um über 4 Prozentpunkte auf rund 54%, 2002 sank er auf 53%. Während der Anteilsrückgang zwischen 2000 und 2001 insbesondere auf die geringere Innovationsaktivitäten der kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen zurückzuführen war, ist für den leichten Rückgang im vergangenen Jahr vor allem das Innovationsverhalten der Unternehmen mit 500 und mehr Beschäftigten ursächlich. Bei Großunternehmen (1 000 und mehr Beschäftigte) nahm der Innovatorenanteil um rund 6 Prozentpunkte und bei Unternehmen mit 500 bis 999 Beschäftigten um rund 4 Prozentpunkte ab. Die Ausschöpfung des vorhandenen Potentials wird in Zukunft zunehmend durch steigende Innovationsaufwendungen in Verbindung mit einer Intensivierung des internationalen Wettbewerbs bedroht. Druck auf den mit Innovationen erzielbaren Return on Investment geht auch von der spürbaren Steigerung des Innovationstempos aus."

      "Although workplace design and management are gaining more and more attention from modern organizations, workplace research is still very fragmented and spread across multiple disciplines in academia. There are several books on the market related to workplaces, facility management (FM), and corporate real estate management (CREM) disciplines, but few open up a theoretical and practical discussion across multiple theories from different fields of studies. Therefore, workplace researchers are not aware of all the angles from which workplace management and effects of workplace design on employees has been or could be studied. A lot of knowledge is lost between disciplines, and sadly, many insights do not reach workplace managers in practice. Therefore, this new book series is started by associate professor Rianne Appel-Meulenbroek (Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands) and postdoc researcher Vitalija Danivska (Aalto University, Finland) as editors, published by Routledge. It is titled 'Transdisciplinary Workplace Research and Management' because it bundles important research insights from different disciplinary fields and shows its relevance for both academic workplace research and workplace management in practice. The books will address the complexity of the transdisciplinary angle necessary to solve ongoing workplace-related issues in practice, such as knowledge worker productivity, office use, and more strategic workplace management. In addition, the editors work towards further collaboration and integration of the necessary disciplines for further development of the workplace field in research and in practice. This book series is relevant for workplace experts both in academia and industry. This first book in the series focuses on the employee as a user of the work environment. The 21 theories discussed and applied to workplace design in this book address people's ability to do their job and thrive in relation to the office workplace. Some focus more on explaining why people behave the way they do (the psychosocial environment), while others take the physical and/or digital workplace quality as a starting point to explain employee outcomes such as health, satisfaction, and performance. They all explain different aspects for achieving employee-workplace alignment (EWA) and thereby ensuring employee thriving. The final chapter describes a first step towards integrating these theories into an overall interdisciplinary framework for eventually developing a grand EWA theory."

Since the estimation of that impact can depend on the order in which the various income sources are introduced into the analysis, it is done by using the Shapley value. Estimates of the poverty reduction impact are presented in a normalized and un-normalized fashion, in order to take into account the total as well as the per dollar impacts. The methodology is applied to data from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) database."

      "This paper proposes a methodology for testing for whether tax reforms are pro-poor. This is done by extending stochastic dominance techniques to help identify tax reforms that will necessarily be deemed absolutely or relatively pro-poor by a wide spectrum of poverty analysts. The statistical properties of the various estimators are also derived in order to make the method implementable using survey data. The methodology is used to assess the pro-poorness of possible reforms to Mexico's indirect tax system. This leads to the identification of several possible pro-poor tax reforms in that country. It also shows how the pro-poorness of a tax reform depends on one's conception of poverty as well as on the revenue and efficiency impact of the reform."

      "Asset management often involves a conflict of interests between investors and fund managers. A main goal of financial regulators is to identify and mitigate this conflict. This article focuses on measures that may foster protection of investors' interests. In an experiment capturing the essential elements of asset management, we find that managers' accountability does not prevent their opportunistic behavior if not backed by a threat of punishment. Further, investors inefficiently sanction managers if not completely aware of managers' choices. To effectively protect investors in financial intermediations, financial regulators should ensure both managers' accountability and a credible sanctioning system."

      "Recent empirical research on efficiency gains for Russia from WTO membership concludes that service trade liberalization especially through allowing foreign suppliers to invest in Russian service industries promises the largest gains. This points to sizable efficiency deficits in the Russian service sector. This paper departs from the question whether both the Russian sectoral protection structure and the effective rates of protection (ERPs) differ from structures and rates in benchmark countries if tax equivalents for intermediate services are taken into account. The result is that almost all Russian service industries get effectively taxed and not protected once not only tax equivalents of intermediate goods but also those of intermediate services are included in ERP calculation. Variance among industries and peak taxes in service industries are significantly higher than in a median emerging country taken as benchmark. These findings support the key role of intermediate services liberalization for the expansion of a viable Russian service sector. Results from comparing Russian effective rates of protection with those of the EU accession countries Bulgaria and Romania are not inclusive. Tax levels of the two accession countries are also high and variant and thus cannot serve as a proxy for the 'economic distance of Russia to Brussels'. Lessons for European Neighborhood Policy point to the requirement for the EU to liberalize bilateral service trade (through mode 3 supply: commercial presence ) on a quid pro quo base: without opening EU markets for Russian companies in specific services (i.e., energy distribution), Russia will probably not open its service sector for EU suppliers more than is required in order to comply with minimum WTO accession prerequisites."

      "This paper shows that franchise extension is not enough for commitment to redistribution and that in the absence of de facto empowerment, the threat of revolution is intact. In particular, the paper studies the relationship between a democratic reform that extends the political rights of a threatening group and redistribution during periods of revolutionary threat. Far from causing an increase in broad redistribution (e.g. social spending), I show that democratic reform - the state organization of a social movement that extends political rights - can be used to identify rebel leaders and provide private goods to them, in return for preventing social unrest and demobilizing their supporters. I study the context of the organization by the state of the most important social movement in Colombian history - the National Peasant Movement (ANUC) - over almost three decades (1957-1985), in which the threat of a Communist Revolution was perennial and throughout which the government gave ANUC direct political participation at the local level in the executive branch and economic support. Using three newly digitized data sets of Colombian municipalities, I find that rather than leading to broad redistribution to the benefit of the peasantry, the reform instead led to an increase in targeted redistribution in terms of public jobs and lands. In particular, by matching the names of the peasant leaders to the beneficiaries of the land reform, evidence suggests that peasant leaders disproportionately benefited from land reform, especially in municipalities where the communist threat was higher. Finally, I find suggestive evidence that buying off the rebel leaders was an effective counter-revolutionary strategy as it led to fewer revolutionary activities after the support of ANUC was terminated (1972-1985)."

      "This paper assessed optimal configurations of hybrid renewable system for rural health clinic (RHC) application in three grid-unconnected rural villages in Nigeria. The RHC consist of an emergency room, consulting room, nurse/injection room, male ward, female ward, a delivery room and a laboratory with average total daily energy consumption of 15.5 kWh and 2.75 kW peak demand. The assessment of configurations that optimally meet the daily load demand with zero loss of power supply probability (LPSP) was carried out using HOMER software, by considering three energy resources; photovoltaic (PV), wind and diesel with battery energy storage. The result obtained revealed hybrid PV/wind/diesel/battery system as the most cost-effective configuration for powering rural health clinic in both Maiduguri and Enugu sites, while that of Iseyin site was found to be hybrid PV/diesel/battery system. In all the sites, the selected optimal configuration is far better than the conventional diesel stand-alone system in terms of cost and emission reduction."

      "This study examines the convergence in military expenditure and economic growth for a panel of 35 African countries between 1990 and 2015. We employ the Phillips and Sul methodology to achieve our objective. Overall, the results at Africa level reveal no evidence of convergence in military expenditure and growth. However, after robustness tests, the final club classification results do support the hypothesis of club convergence for the two variables. The results of the analysis show that there exist: (i) two convergence clubs for military expenditure; and (ii) five convergence clubs for growth. The empirical findings further suggest that the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) form distinct convergent and divergent clubs, exhibiting considerable heterogeneity in the underlying defence and growth patterns. In addition, the empirics confirm that the countries in each region appear to have chosen dissimilar defence and growth transition paths. The policy implications are discussed in the concluding section of this study."

      "This study uses a systematic review in examining the factors that may have a negative impact on social enterprises in Indonesia within an institutional framework. An institutional framework was used in this study to update existing studies. Moreover, this study is also intended to explore the obstacles that may exist in improving the performance of social entrepreneurs in Indonesia. A systematic review of the literature is the approach used in this analysis. A researcher can draw plausible observations and present generalizable research by carrying out a comprehensive literature analysis, which is found by predefined literature search techniques. This study was carried out in two stages to complement the systematic analysis, as described below. Eighteen references were found using the literature review criteria and used in the qualitative synthesis. The idea of social entrepreneurship was introduced by the Indonesian government in 2015. Social entrepreneurship has been impacted by the global downturn, political instability, government bureaucracy, and society. Building a solid regulatory system for social enterprise would aid in the success of these businesses. The Indonesian government should provide an awareness center as well as give recommendations to assist the community in navigating the complex cultural landscape. The significance of this study is that it has the potential to affect policy decisions in order to change the structural climate for social entrepreneurship. International investors who want to start a social enterprise in Indonesia can also learn about the institutional structure and how it affects their venture."

      "We study a communication game of common interest in which the sender observes one of infinite types and sends one of finite messages which is interpreted by the receiver. In equilibrium there is no full separation but types are clustered into convex categories. We give a full characterization of the strict Nash equilibria of this game by representing these categories by Voronoi languages. As the strategy set is infinite static stability concepts for finite games such as ESS are no longer sufficient for Lyapunov stability in the replicator dynamics. We give examples of unstable strict Nash equilibria and stable inefficient Voronoi languages. We derive efficient Voronoi languages with a large number of categories and numerically illustrate stability of some Voronoi languages with large message spaces and non-uniformly distributed types."

      "We analyse a 2-period competitive insurance market which is characterized by the simultaneous presence of standard moral hazard and adverse selection with regard to consumer time preferences. It is shown that there exists an equilibrium in which patient consumers use high effort and buy a profit-making insurance contract with high coverage, whereas impatient consumers use low effort and buy a contract with low coverage or even remain uninsured. This finding may help to explain why positive profits and the opposite of adverse selection with regard to risk types can sometimes be observed empirically."

      "Humans are fundamentally social. Social activities require coordination, which may yield multiple equilibria in the form of stable, self-reinforcing patterns of herd behavior. Since environmental impacts can differ substantially between alternative equilibria, such self-reinforcing behaviors may, from an environmental perspective, be viewed as representing virtuous or vicious cycles. Environmental policies can help break the self-fulfilling expectations of vicious cycles, tipping the economy to more environment-friendly equilibria."

      "We study the role of proximity to historical ethnic borders in determining individual land ownership in Sub-Saharan Africa. Following an instrumental variable strategy, we document that individuals have a lower likelihood of owning land near historical ethnic borders. In particular, the likelihood of owning land decreases by 15 percentage points, i.e., about 1/3 of the mean rate of landownership, for rural migrants who move from 57km (90th percentile) to 2 km (10th percentile) from the border. This result aligns with the view that competition for land is stronger and property rights are weaker close to historical ethnic borders in Sub-Saharan Africa."

      "African countries have over the years experienced persistent current account deficits. The role of asymmetries in explaining the response of trade balance to exchange rate movement has not received adequate attention as linear models dominate extant empirical literature. In this paper, we examined the impact of exchange rate on the trade balance in five African countries using both linear and nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag models to analyze data for the period 1980-2018. The linear model revealed that the J-curve holds in Uganda in the short run, whereas evidence of long-run J-curve effect was found only in Algeria. However, the nonlinear analysis showed that the short-run J-curve holds for South Africa and Uganda whereas a long-run J-curve effect was found in Algeria and Uganda. The results make a case for modeling asymmetries as the nonlinear model performed relatively better. An important policy implication is the need to address structural imbalances in the economy to leverage on the exchange rate and trade policies to improve trade outcomes."

      "In einer sich verändernden Welt, in der zunehmend ökonomische Entscheidungen zu treffen sind, rücken das Finanzwissen und die -kompetenzen in den Vordergrund. Insbesondere für den Bereich der Altersvorsorge ist dies wichtig und dabei gerade für Frauen, denn diese sind stärker von einer geringen Altersabsicherung betroffen; die fehlende Absicherung über die gesetzliche und betriebliche Rentenversicherung muss über den Kapitalmarkt generiert werden. Obwohl die Ausstattung mit Finanzwissen und -kompetenzen daher für diese Gruppe besonders wichtig ist, zeigt es sich aber, dass Frauen ein geringeres Finanzwissen und auch geringere Finanzkompetenzen aufweisen als Männer. In diesem Beitrag machen wir deutlich, dass neben Bildung und Einkommen auch die Arbeitsmarktpartizipation eine Erklärung hierfür ist.",
      "In an ever-changing world, with decisions of an increasing economic focus, financial education and financial literacy are becoming increasingly important. This is especially the case concerning old-age provision and retirement planning. Women in particular are more affected by a low level of old-age provision and the lack of coverage through statutory and occupational pensions. So, additional insurances must be generated via the capital market. Endowment with financial literacy is therefore particularly important for this group. Nonetheless, it is shown, that women have less financial knowledge than men do. This article makes it clear that in addition to education and income, the labour market participation can be another explanation for this gender gap."

      "Vector autoregressions have steadily gained in popularity since their introduction in econometrics 25 years ago. A drawback of the otherwise fairly well developed methodology is the inability to incorporate prior beliefs regarding the system's steady state in a satisfactory way. Such prior information are typically readily available and may be crucial for forecasts at long horizons. This paper develops easily implemented numerical simulation algorithms for analyzing stationary and cointegrated VARs in a parametrization where prior beliefs on the steady state may be adequately incorporated. The analysis is illustrated on macroeconomic data for the Euro area."

      "In his article, Sebastian Knake challenges the general assumption that traditional savings accounts in the US disappeared naturally as a result of the combination of interest rate regulation and extraordinarily high market interest rates during the stagflation period. By comparing the US experience with simultaneous developments in West Germany, he finds that the opportunity costs of owning a regular passbook were comparable in both countries. In contrast to the US case, however, the passbook remained a cornerstone of household saving in Germany. Drawing upon research in several bank archives in the US and Germany, Knake explains these divergent developments in terms of fundamental differences in how banks and their customers communicated over prices. In the US, a peculiar combination of regulative rules forced banks, and especially savings institutions, to aggressively promote new types of bank accounts that were introduced by federal regulation authorities, thereby increasing nominal interest rate expectations. In Germany, by contrast, banks confined information about advantageous investment opportunities to the smallest possible share of the customer base. These divergent communication strategies reflect a difference in the balance of power in the bank-customer relationship. German customers depended on their primary-and in most cases only-bank relationship to acquire information on alternative investments, while US customers could draw on several relationships with banks and savings institutions to obtain the relevant information. Thus, the fate of the passbook was sealed by the ability or inability of banks to keep their customers in the dark about the real opportunity costs of passbook saving."

      "In this paper we incorporate a labor market with matching frictions and wage rigidities into the New Keynesian business cycle model. In particular, we analyze the effect of a monetary policy shock and investigate how labor market frictions affect the transmission process of monetary policy. The model allows real wage rigidities to interact with adjustments in employment and hours affecting inflation dynamics via marginal costs. We find that the response of unemployment and inflation to an interest rate innovation depends on the degree of wage rigidity. Generally, more rigid wages translate into more persistent movements of aggregate inflation. Moreover, the impact of a monetary policy shock on unemployment and inflation depends also on labor market fundamentals such as bargaining power and the flows in and out of employment."

      "We investigate how R&D spillovers propagate across firms linked through Research Joint Ventures (RJVs). Building on the framework developed by Bloom et al. (2013) which considers the opposing effects of knowledge spillovers and product market rivalry, we extend the model to account for RJV cooperation. Since the firm’s decision to join a RJV is endogenous, we build a model of RJV participation. The outcome equations and RJV participation are then jointly estimated in an endogenous treatment regression model. Our main findings are that the adverse effects of product market rivalry are mitigated if firms cooperate in RJVs; and that RJV participation allows firms to better absorb technological spillovers and, thus, create value."

      "The long history of sovereign debt and the associated enforcement problem have attracted researchers in many fields. In this paper, we survey empirical work by economists, historians, and political scientists. As we review the empirical literature, we emphasize parallel developments in the theory of sovereign debt. One major theme emerges. Although recent research has sought to balance theoretical and empirical considerations, there remains a gap between theories of sovereign debt and the data used to test them. We recommend a number of steps that researchers can take to improve the correspondence between theory and data."

      "Amidst growing concerns over heightened natural disaster risks, this study pioneers an inquiry into the causal impacts of cyclones on the demand for private health insurance (PHI) in Australia. We amalgamate a nationally representative longitudinal dataset with historical cyclone records, employing an individual fixed effects model to assess the impacts of various exogenously determined cyclone exposure measures. Our findings unveil that both contemporaneous and preceding cyclones, particularly those of greater severity, substantially increase the likelihood of individuals procuring PHI. The largest estimated impact amounts to over 4 percentage points, representing approximately 8% of the sample mean and aligns with documented effects of certain PHI policies aimed at enhancing coverage. Furthermore, our findings withstand a series of sensitivity assessments, including a placebo test demonstrating that future cyclones do not impact current PHI enrolment. Moreover, the cyclone impacts are more pronounced for females, younger individuals, homeowners, affluent individuals, or those with prior residential insurance coverage, as well as residents of rural and coastal areas or historically cyclone-exposed regions. Additionally, our study furnishes suggestive evidence hinting at a potential rise in risk aversion among affected individuals as a channel through which cyclones increase PHI uptake."

      "High growth firms (HGFs) are important for job creation and considered to be precursors of economic growth. We investigate how product- and labor-market regulations, as well as the quality of regional governments that implement these regulations, affect HGF development across European regions. Using data from Eurostat, OECD, WEF, and Gothenburg University, we show that both regulatory stringency and the quality of the regional government influence the regional shares of HGFs. Additionally, we find that the effect of labor- and product-market regulations ultimately depends on the quality of regional governments. The institutional quality has a moderating role in defining the effect of regulations on the regional shares of HGFs. Our findings contribute to the debate on the effects of regulations by showing that regulations are not, per se, \"good, bad, and ugly\", rather their impact depends on the efficiency of regional governments. Our paper offers important building blocks to develop tailored policy measures that may influence the development of HGFs in a region."

      "Global economic governance stands for the institutions, regulations and mechanisms that manage the increasing interdependency of global challenges in the world economy and forms the foundation of stable global economic development. However, global economic governance remains largely mired in “silo thinking”: it is broken down too distinctly into different subject areas, despite the fact that globalisation has led to an increasing overlap in policy areas, with political decisions in one area also affecting others. For these close interrelations, the handling of trade finance and the parallel lack of coordinated and coherent global economic governance are important examples. Trade finance stands at the interface between trade policy and financial market regulation. Despite this, the relevant institutions, in particular the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), do not liaise with one another to an adequate extent. During the financial and economic crisis, there was a dramatic slump in trade finance. The inadequate availability of trade finance has been a significant barrier to trade since then, and it may inhibit economic development in developing and emerging countries in particular. The G20 consequently saw the need to act promptly. In 2009 it organized support to the amount of US$ 250 billion to reduce the gaps in trade financing opportunities that had emerged. The global financial and economic crisis raised the need for a reform of the global banking regulation system. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision of the BIS consequently initiated the Basel III reform package, designed to make the banking and finance systems more resilient. During the past months, there has been intense debate regarding the extent to which Basel III could inhibit trade finance, and therefore international trade flows. Although financial regulation does not constitute a focal point of the mandate of the WTO, the organisation should nonetheless have an interest in closer cooperation with the BIS and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The WTO does indeed serve as a discussion forum for relevant players in the field of trade finance; however, cooperation between the WTO and the BIS is not adequately institutionalised, and key actors such as developing countries are not sufficiently involved in the decision-making process. The insufficiently coordinated and incoherent regulatory framework has resulted in a lack of uniformity in implementing Basel III in different regions. Such a fragmentation of banking regulations presents a problem, as it results in regulatory arbitrage and can serve to undermine the conditions for fair competition. Therefore, there is an urgent need for action, if the anticipated growth in world trade following the latest WTO conference in Bali is also to be financed."

      "This paper discusses theoretical and practical issues related to long-term care (LTC) services in Latin America. Demand for these services will rise as the region undergoes a swift demographic transition from its currently young population to a rapidly aging one, especially since the region's aging cohorts are more prone to experience a decline in their functional and physical abilities than elderly people elsewhere in the world. We argue that private insurance markets are ill-equipped to provide coverage to meet the need for LTC, while the amount of personal savings required to afford self-insurance is prohibitively high. We study how developed economies have dealt with the issue of LTC and pay special attention to the most salient features of their LTC programs. We then direct the discussion to Latin America, where LTC may not be an immediate priority, but governments are likely to encourage the development of LTC programs as demand for them steadily grows. In particular, policymakers are probably going to focus initially on LTC programs for the poor and the vulnerable, for whom LTC affordability is a greater problem. We therefore study how basic elements of policy design affect costeffectiveness of LTC programs by means of a formal model. Our study shows that propoor programs are more cost effective when people have the option to receive cash subsidies, and the availability of in-kind and in-cash choices reduces program costs overall. We argue that our findings are natural starting points to start thinking about LTC program development in the region."

      "Die Lausitz durchläuft einen durch den Ausstieg aus der Braunkohleverstromung bedingten Strukturwandel. Dieser soll durch eine Vielzahl von Aktivitäten, Fördermitteln und neue Institutionen proaktiv gestaltet werden. Man erhofft sich neue wirtschaftliche Impulse und verstärkte Innovationsaktivitäten in der Region. Für die Schaffung von Innovationen fällt dem Wissens- und Technologietransfer (WTT) eine wichtige Rolle zu. Gerade in dieser bewegten Phase eines großen Transformationsprozesses stellt sich die Frage, wie es um das Angebot des WTT bestellt ist. Gibt es ausreichend und passende Impulse aus der Wissenschaft für Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft, werden diese bedarfsgerecht vermittelt? Für ein \"gutes\" WTT-Angebot gibt es einige Anforderungen. Diese werden im vorliegenden Arbeitspapier dargestellt. Anschließend wird überprüft, ob das aktuelle Angebot in der Lausitz diesen Anforderungen genügt, basierend auf einer Expert:innenbefragung verschiedener im WTT aktiver Organisationen der Region."

      "We study the impact of public child care on mothers' career trajectories, focusing on qualitative dimensions of career choices. Using an event study approach, we find that child care helps mothers to return to the labor market more quickly and that this effect is mainly due to an increase in part-time employment. At the same time, we find no short- or long-term effects of child care on the quality of maternal careers, as measured, for example, by employment stability, employment in occupations with abstract tasks, or employment in managerial positions. Furthermore, we find no evidence of heterogeneous effects across mothers."

      "This paper examines the effectiveness of labor cost reductions as a means to stimulate economic activity and assesses the differences which may occur with the prevailing exchange rate regime. We develop a medium-scale three-region DSGE model and show that the impact of a cut in employers' social security contributions rate does not vary significantly under different exchange rate regimes. We find that both the interest rate and the exchange rate channel matters. Furthermore, the measure appears to be effective even if it comes along with a consumption tax increase to preserve long-term fiscal sustainability. Finally, we assess whether obtained theoretical results hold up empirically by applying the local projection method. Regression results suggest that changes in employers' social security contributions rates have statistically significant real effects - a one percentage point reduction leads to an average cumulative rise in output of around 1.3 percent in the medium term. Moreover, the outcome does not differ significantly across the different exchange rate regimes."

      "We investigate to what extent the probability that a Specific Trade Concern (STC) is raised in the WTO against a Member in a given sector is affected by past reductions in applied tariffs. Employing an identification strategy based on 'new measures', we find evidence of a substitution of non-tariff measures for tariffs both in the sample of TBT and in the sample of SPS concerns. While in the SPS sample this result holds both among developed and developing economies, in the TBT sample such 'trade policy substitution' only occurs when the country maintaining the measure at issue is economically developed. These results are consistent with our theoretical model, which predicts policy substitution between tariffs and standards in economies where meeting such standards is relatively less costly and in sectors where meeting such standards is relatively more important from the perspective of producers."

      "The design of regression models that are not affected by outliers is an important task which has been subject of numerous papers within the statistics community for the last decades. Prominent examples of robust regression models are least trimmed squares (LTS), where the k largest squared deviations are ignored, and least trimmed absolute deviations (LTA) which ignores the k largest absolute deviations. The numerical complexity of both models is driven by the number of binary variables and by the value k of ignored deviations. We introduce leveraged least trimmed absolute deviations (LLTA) which exploits that LTA is already immune against y-outliers. Therefore, LLTA has only to be guarded against outlying values in x, so-called leverage points, which can be computed beforehand, in contrast to y-outliers. Thus, while the mixed-integer formulations of LTS and LTA have as many binary variables as data points, LLTA only needs one binary variable per leverage point, resulting in a significant reduction of binary variables. Based on 11 data sets from the literature, we demonstrate that (1) LLTA’s prediction quality improves much faster than LTS and as fast as LTA for increasing values of k and (2) that LLTA solves the benchmark problems about 80 times faster than LTS and about five times faster than LTA, in median."

We show that a superior price-investment equilibrium can be sustained in the long-term, if the policy-maker is enough forward looking and allowed to build reputation. In the short-term, time-inconsistency can be alleviated by complementing carbon pricing with project-based carbon price guarantees."

      "Agents participating in different kind of organizations, usually take different positions in some relational structure. The aim of this paper is to introduce a new framework taking into account both communication and hierachical features derived from this participation. In fact, this new set or network structure unifies and generalizes well-known models from the literature, such as communication networks and hierarchies. We introduce and analyze accessible union stable systems where union stability reflects the communication network and accessibility describes the hierarchy. Particular cases of these new structures are the sets of connected coalitions in a communication graph, antimatroids (and therefore also sets of feasible coalitions in permission structures) and augmenting systems which have numerous applications in the literature. We give special attention to th e class of cycle-free accessible union stable systems. We also consider cooperative games with restricted cooperation where the set of feasible coalitions is an accessible union stable system, and provide an axiomatization of an extension of the Shapley value to this class of games."

      "The difficulty or inability to borrow made capital market constraints an important part of the decision of potential emigrants to move from Europe to North America. We formalize the constraint with a life-cycle model, where agents jointly choose the optimal period of saving to finance migration and whether to migrate. Simulations of the model point to the potential role of preferences, the period of adjustment after arrival, and the direct migration costs in determining who will migrate and at what age; and they help account for the large wage gaps between the Old and New World. Our analysis of data from the passenger manifests of Dutch arrivals at Canadian ports from 1925 to 1927, that importantly include the saving of these immigrants, points to the promise of this approach to international migration."

      "In dem kompetitiven Markt für logistische Dienstleistungen ist die Prozessinnovationsfähigkeit für Logistikdienstleistungsunternehmen eine erfolgskritische Größe. Unter der Prozessinnovationsfähigkeit eines Logistikdienstleistungsunternehmens wird die Eigenschaft verstanden, durch neue oder verbesserte methodische, soziale, strukturelle oder technologische Konzepte, die Effizienz eines Logistiksystems fortlaufend zu verbessern und Kundenanforderung effizient zu erfüllen und zu übertreffen. Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, Entscheidungsträger von Logistikdienstleistungsunternehmen bei der zielgerichteten Entwicklung ihrer Prozessinnovationsfähigkeit zu unterstützen und die Komplexität dieser Aufgabe besser beherrschbar zu machen. Dabei werden insbesondere Anbieter komplexer, lagerbasierte Logistikdienstleistungen adressiert. Zu diesem Zweck wird ein auf empirisch untersuchten Erfolgsfaktoren basierendes Reifegradmodell für die Prozessinnovationsfähigkeit bei Logistikdienstleistungsunternehmen entwickelt. Dieses Reifegradmodell bietet einerseits die Möglichkeit zur Bewertung der jeweils bestehenden Prozessinnovationsfähigkeit. Andererseits zeigt das Modell von dem ermittelten Fähigkeitsgrad ausgehend konkrete Handlungskonzepte auf, um identifizierte Fähigkeitslücken zu schließen und die Prozessinnovationsfähigkeit in der jeweiligen Situation gezielt weiterzuentwickeln. Im Rahmen der Untersuchung findet ein Mix aus qualitativen und quantitativen Methoden Anwendung. Die enge Einbindung der betroffenen Praxis in den Forschungsprozess unterstützt die Anwendbarkeit der Ergebnisse.",

      "Mohring and Harwitz (1962) showed that, under certain conditions, an optimally designed and priced road would generate user toll revenues just sufficient to cover its capital costs. Several scholars subsequently explored the robustness of that finding. This paper briefly summarizes further research on the relationship between congestion-toll revenues and road costs. Despite its transparency, the self-financing theorem can lead to erroneous interpretations. The paper’s second part discusses three such possible fallacies. It uses a simple numerical model to investigate them. The model shows that the naïve interpretation of the Mohring-Harwitz rule may lead to substantial welfare losses. These losses are particularly prominent when the difference between capital and investment cost is confused and when balanced-budget constraints are imposed under second-best network conditions. In contrast, losses from imposing a balanced-budget constraint when economies or diseconomies of scale exist are surprisingly small."

      "Developed as well as developing countries will have to increase their ambition relative to their stated Nationally Determined Contributions to limit global temperature increases to 2êC above pre-industrial levels. South Africa's Nationally Determined Contribution, in line with national policy, is to follow a peak, plateau, and decline emissions trajectory to 2050, with the contribution post-2030 contingent on a fair contribution from other countries. Given the high levels of unemployment, poverty, and inequality in South Africa, there are concerns that a rapid transition to a low-carbon energy system would have severe socioeconomic consequences. This paper builds on initial work from the Deep Decarbonisation Pathways Project, and analyses the impacts on the energy system and the economy of an increase in ambition, in order to shed light on these concerns. The key policy recommendation from this analysis is that further investments in fossil fuel infrastructure in South Africa will have significant negative socioeconomic implications, and that further work should be done to reassess development pathways that could mitigate these negative impacts."

      "Purpose: This paper considers a two-echelon supply chain composed of one risk-neutral supplier and two risk-averse retailers. The retailers obtain production from the supplier and sell them to the market. Based on the cooperative game theory, the paper studies the appropriate profit allocation of the supply chain when all the players cooperate with each other, where the two retailers face a price-sensitive stochastic demand. The two retailers can either determine their retail prices independently, or decide whether or not to cooperate with each other. Design/methodology/approach: To allocate the system-wide profit among upstream risk-neutral suppliers and two risk-averse downstream retailers, this paper constructed a cooperative game model, considered as the supermodularity of the characteristic function and the Shapley value of the game. Findings and Originality/value: By analyzing the construction's cooperative game model, the results show that the profit of the whole supply chain is the highest in the grand coalition structure. This paper also shows that the core of our cooperative game is nonempty, and has the supermodularity property. Based on this, we have computed the Shapley value-based profit allocation for the whole supply chain in a fair manner. Originality/value: Although there are a lot of literature examined risk aversion in a supply chain, but they did not consider using cooperative game to study this problem. This the first study is in the context of a supply chain with risk aversion problem."

      "Our paper makes a first attempt to address the impact of skills and skill use in the analysis of the gender wage gap using the PIAAC dataset. Using the case of Austria, we show that skill use as well as the skill match play an important role with regard to wage regressions of men as well as women. When we take skills into account in the gender wage gap analysis, the unexplained part of the gender wage gap is reduced by almost 4 percentage points along the whole wage distribution. Our results suggest that skill use and match play a crucial role in explaining the gender wage gap. Additionally, we show, that the self-selection problem biases the results, in particular in the lower and middle parts of the wage distribution and that we should control for it, although the effect is small. When we additionally consider discretionary bonus payments, we find that the unexplained part in the gender wage gap increases, especially in the upper part of the wage distribution."

However, their overall implications remain poorly understood, as studies have mostly focused on assessing their effects on single sustainability dimensions. Here, we use an interdisciplinary approach to understand the simultaneous effects of sustainability standards on socioeconomic and ecological outcomes in Ghana's cocoa sector. Our study is based on a rich dataset comprising representative household data from 814 smallholder cocoa-producing households from five major cocoa regions and ecological data from 119 cocoa plots. Results from the endogenous switching regression approach suggest that sustainability standards have positive effects on socioeconomic outcomes such as cocoa yield, net cocoa income and net returns to land. However, using generalized linear mixed effects models, we do not find any significant associations with ecological outcomes related to vegetation structure and animal diversity. Our results indicate that sustainability standards in Ghana's cocoa sector lead to socioeconomic benefits but not to ecological benefits for the plot environment. Nevertheless, yield increases do not come at the expense of biodiversity. We conclude that sustainability standards have the potential to improve socioeconomic outcomes, without significantly creating trade-offs with ecological outcomes."

      "Electricity needs to be consumed at the very moment of production, leading wholesale prices to fluctuate widely at (sub-)hourly time scales. This article investigates the response of aggregate electricity demand to such price variations. Using wind energy as an instrument, we estimate a significant and robust short-term price elasticity of about -0.05 in Germany and attribute this to industrial consumers. While seemingly modest, our results imply that even with limited exposure to real time prices, short-term demand response facilitates decarbonization of the electricity grid by reducing the need for battery storage or backup fossil power by approximately 8%."

      "Die Weltwirtschaft erholte sich nach dem kräftigen Anstieg der Produktion im Sommer auch im Winterhalbjahr weiter, obwohl die Zahl der Neuinfektionen mit dem Coronavirus stark zunahm und die Eindämmungsmaßnahmen in vielen Ländern erneut verschärft wurden. Industrieproduktion und Welthandel haben sich bereits fast vollständig erholt und scheinen von der zweiten Welle der Pandemie kaum beeinträchtigt zu werden. Die europäische Wirtschaft rutschte zwar erneut in die Rezession. Der Rückgang der gesamtwirtschaftlichen Produktion dürfte aber nicht dramatisch sein und von einer kräftigen Erholung im Sommerhalbjahr abgelöst werden, sofern die Fortschritte bei der Impfkampagne wie erwartet eine durchgreifende Lockerung der Restriktionen ab dem Frühjahr zulassen. Damit wird sich weltweit der Aufschwung im Verlauf dieses Jahres zunehmend auf bislang noch stark belastete Wirtschaftsbereiche wie den Tourismus und das Veranstaltungswesen sowie Regionen ausdehnen, deren Wirtschaft in besonderem Maß auf diese Aktivitäten ausgerichtet ist. Auf der Basis von Kaufkraftparitäten dürfte die Weltproduktion im Jahr 2021 um 6,7 Prozent und im Jahr 2022 um 4,7 Prozent steigen und damit den Vorkrisenpfad am Ende des Prognosezeitraums nur noch leicht unterschreiten. Wir haben unsere Prognose vom Dezember für dieses und das nächste Jahr um jeweils 0,6 Prozent angehoben, hierzu hat nicht zuletzt eine deutliche Verbesserung der Aussichten für die Vereinigten Staaten beigetragen. Der internationale Warenhandel dürfte im Durchschnitt dieses Jahres um 7,5 Prozent und im kommenden Jahr um 3,7 Prozent zulegen. Trotz des im vergangenen Jahr verzeichneten Rückgangs um 5,4 Prozent wird er damit im kommenden Jahr sogar höher ausfallen als vor der Krise erwartet.",
      "The global economy continued to recover in the winter semester, despite the number of new infections with the coronavirus rising sharply and containment measures tightened again in many countries. Industrial production and world trade have already fully catched up with activity levels before the pandemic and appear to be little affected by the second wave of Covid-19. While the European economy did slip into recession again, the decline in GDP is not expected to be dramatic and should be followed by a strong recovery from spring onward, provided that progress in vaccination allows a substantial and sustained relaxation of measures designed to suppress the virus. In the course of this year, the global upturn will thus increasingly extend to economic sectors that remain severely impeded for the time being, such as tourism and entertainment, and to economies that are particularly geared to these activities. On a purchasing power parity basis, global output is expected to increase by 6.7 percent in 2021 and by 4.7 percent in 2022, thus progressively closing the gap to the pre-crisis path of activity towards the end of the forecast period. We have raised our December forecast by 0.6 percent for both this year and next, with a particularly strong improvement in the outlook for the United States. World trade in goods is expected to grow by 7.5 percent this year. With growth of 4.7 percent this year and next, respectively, Towards the end of the forecast horizon world trade will thus be even higher than expected before the crisis."

      "We present a theory of exchange that provides an alternative explanation for the endowment effect. Unlike standard neoclassical theories and Prospect Theory, our approach is not based on preference structure, but on adaptive responses to the problem of exchange when value is uncertain. We combine assumptions from perceptual and economic theory into a highly generalised model. Agents who maximise surplus but perceive uncertainty in the value of goods, set willingness to accept (WTA) above willingness to pay (WTP). The disparity increases with the perceived uncertainty of value. We show also how feedback over repeated exchanges may have heuristic value in learning to set optimal WTA and WTP. Our model receives some support from empirical studies of exchange."

      "This paper provides theoretical and empirical insights into the puzzling simultaneous rise in foreign direct investment inflows in Africa and capital flight from the continent over the past decades. Indeed, paradoxically, even as African countries have become more attractive to foreign private capital, they have continued to experience capital exodus in the context of improved economic performance, especially since the turn of the century. This paper explores three questions. First, does foreign direct investment fuel capital flight as has been established in the case of external borrowing? In other words, is there an FDI-fueled capital flight phenomenon akin to debt-fueled capital flight? Second, is natural resource endowment a possible channel for the capital flight-FDI link, given that resource-rich countries tend to be both preferred destinations of FDI and prominent sources of capital flight? Third, does the quality of institutions mitigate the impact of natural resources on capital flight? The paper develops a theoretical model that conceptualizes these linkages and sets the stage for an econometric investigation of these questions. The results from econometric analysis based on a sample of 30 African countries over the period 1970-2015 show that FDI flows are positively related to capital flight, suggesting a possible FDI-fueled capital flight phenomenon. However, there is no evidence for an FDI overhang effect; past stock of FDI has no impact on capital flight. High natural resource rents are associated with high capital flight and the quality of institutions does not mitigate this link. The paper offers some policy insights derived from the empirical results."

      "In the past years biofuels have received increased attention since they were believed to contribute to rural development, energy security and to fight global warming. It became also clear, though, that bioenergy cannot be evaluated independently of the rest of the economy and that national and international feedback effects are important. Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models have been widely employed in order to study the effects of international climate policies. The main characteristic of these models is their encompassing scope: Global models cover the whole world economy disaggregated into regions and countries as well as diverse sectors of economic activity. Such a modelling framework unveils direct and indirect feedback effects of certain policies or shocks across sectors and countries. CGE models are thus well suited for the study of bioenergy/biofuel policies. One can currently find various approaches in the literature of incorporating bioenergy into a CGE framework. This paper intends to give an overview of existing approaches and to critically assess their respective power. Grouping different approaches into categories and highlighting their advantages and disadvantages is important for giving a structure to this rather recent and rapidly growing research area and to provide a guidepost for future work."

      "This paper evaluates income distributions in four European countries (Austria, Italy, Spain and Hungary) using two complementary approaches: a standard approach based on reported incomes in survey data, and a microsimulation approach, where taxes and benefits are simulated. Given that benefit receipts tend to be under-reported in survey data, and over-estimated in microsimulation procedures, we may expect the two approaches to generate slightly different results. In fact, we find reasonably consistent results. To the extent that the results differ, we explore why these differences occur, and suggest directions for future research, where each approach may inform improvements in the other."

      "We assess the effect of aggregate stock market illiquidity on U.S. Treasury bond risk premia. We find that the stock market illiquidity variable adds to the well established Cochrane-Piazzesi and Ludvigson-Ng factors. It explains 10%, 9%, 7%, and 7% of the one-year-ahead variation in the excess return for two-, three-, four-, and five-year bonds respectively and increases the adjusted R2 by 3-6% across all maturities over Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005) and Ludvigson and Ng (2009) factors. The effects are highly statistically and economically significant both in and out of sample. We find that our result is robust to and is not driven by information from open interest in the futures market, long-run inflation expectations, dispersion in beliefs, and funding liquidity. We argue that stock market illiquidity is a timely variable that is related to right-to-quality episodes and might contain information about expected future business conditions through funding liquidity and investment channels."

      "This paper introduces an estimation procedure for a random effects probit model in presence of heteroskedasticity and a likelihood ratio test for homoskedasticity. The cases where the heteroskedasticity is due to individual effects or idiosyncratic errors or both are analyzed. Monte Carlo simulations show that the test performs well in the case of high degree of heteroskedasticity. Furthermore, the power of the test increases with larger individual and time dimensions. The robustness analysis shows that applying the wrong approach may generate misleading results except for the case where both individual effects and idiosyncratic errors are modelled as heteroskedastic."

      "The Philippines is generally winning its fight against poverty as the magnitude and incidence of poverty, income gap, and severity of poverty have all decreased in 2018. Poverty decomposition analysis shows that both economic growth and income redistribution factors have equally contributed to the declining poverty levels. However, the decline in poverty gap and poverty severity is largely explained by income redistribution. On the other hand, while inequality measures indicate a more equal distribution of income, poverty indicators continue to vary widely across the regions. Given these developments, the Philippine government has been enacting different policies and programs, including the conditional cash transfer program, social pension program, progressive taxation policies, and universal access to tertiary education policy, to further address poverty and inequality in country in pursuit of eradicating all forms of poverty as targeted by the Sustainable Development Goals."

      "With the goal to shed more light on the effectiveness of parental time spent with their children, I estimate the causal relationship between parental involvement and education outcomes of children. My research is the first which examines the effect of parental time in terms of the engagement in child's everyday life. Moreover, I improve the existing literature by including the characteristics of children as well as parents. To estimate causal treatment effects, I use a simple logistic regression along with a subclassification on the propensity score. By subclassification, the systematic differences in baseline characteristics are eliminated. The education outcome is represented by a binary variable denoting whether the respondent completed high school or not. Completing high school improves person's economic selfsufficiency and civic engagement. The results indicate higher probability of graduating from high school with higher parental involvement. Moreover, the probability decreases when child disobeys his or her parent. Most importantly, the results suggest that the expected probability of completing high school decreases with more strict parental behavior."

      "In contrast to his contribution to other areas, Shubhashis Gangopadhyay's contributions to our understanding of poverty are often thought of as indirect consequences of the main themes of his work. Yet in more than 15 published papers Gangopadhyay directly takes on poverty, including its estimate and understanding its sources. Our contribution honours Gangopadhyay's work in this area by outlining an approach useful in deconstructing the changes and differences in the likelihood of poverty incidence. We highlight how far it can take us, and how it still leaves us far short of understanding much of what drives poverty."

      "In South Africa the adoption and growth of online shopping is relatively slow. The primary objective of this study was to investigate possible perceived risk barriers that might influence the online shopping behaviour of technologically enabled Generation Y South African consumers. Perceived risk was investigated by means of an online questionnaire in the context of high-involvement products (clothing), and low-involvement products (books). Consideration was also given to experienced and inexperienced online consumers. Results indicate that, for experienced online shoppers, the dimensions of perceived risk that showed significant relationships with their online repurchase intention were psychological risk and social risk (both retailer reputation and social influences), for clothing and books. Time risk was furthermore significant for experienced consumers in terms of books. For inexperienced online shoppers, results showed that financial risk and social risk (retailer reputation), had a significant relationship with online purchase intention for clothing and books. In addition, an equal size multi group analysis between the experienced and inexperienced online consumers for books, indicated no significant differences in the relationship between all the perceived risk dimensions and purchase/repurchase intent. For clothing significant differences were found for the relationships between financial risk and psychological risk and purchase/repurchase intent. The insights gained from the findings can be used by South African online retailers to improve their understanding of technologically enabled consumers and develop more focused and effective marketing strategies to grow online shopping."

      "The question whether technological progress displaces employment or whether technological advance is beneficial for the level of employment has been in the core of economic dispute for over two centuries. The beneficial might be achieved by several compensation mechanisms within the economic system. In this paper we categorize these compensation mechanisms into two basic categories that reflect the different nature of the ideas ruling the compensation. We discriminate the mechanisms employment despite of innovation from employment via innovation. In the context of new innovation economics we model an artificial industry implementing both compensation mechanisms. Simulation analysis is used to examine the short run and the long run properties of the model. There we focus on the influence of wage restraint policy on the functioning of the compensation mechanism."

      "This paper deals with a critical assessment and a reestimation of the \"non-accelerating in ation rate of unemployment\" (NAIRU) for Germany. There are quite a few obstacles to perceiving the NAIRU as an understandable and easy-to-use analytical instrument, suitable for economic policy: the possibility of a non-vertical Phillips curve (e.g. in times of low in ation), the occurrence of shocks and hysteresis effects, the (mis-)measurement of important variables such as in ation expectations, cointegration issues, and a time variability of the NAIRU and its confidence intervals. Despite many serious caveats a new attempt is made to estimate a NAIRU for Germany based on conventional Phillips curves as well as on new approaches such as using direct measures of in ationary expectations, the Kalman filter method, and the residual-based bootstrap procedure (in order to estimate confidence intervals). However, by any method, simple or complex, the NAIRU is very hard to determine and subject to considerable arbitrariness."

      "Die geologisch verfügbare Menge an Metallen wie Kupfer wird kontrovers diskutiert. Die Rohstoffpolitik sollte sich besser am eigentlich einschränkenden Faktor, der erforderlichen Energie zur Rohstoffbereitstellung, statt an dieser spekulativen Diskussion orientieren. Dazu ist ein Verständnis des energetischen Aufwands und seiner Einflussfaktoren unerlässlich. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird ein generisches Modell der Kupfergewinnung vorgestellt und der kumulierte Energieaufwand (KEA) sowie das Treibhausgaspotential (GWP) der Primärkupferbereitstellung für Deutschland ermittelt. Der mittels des Modells berechnete KEA beträgt 40 MJ/kg Cu, das GWP 3,3 kg CO2-Äq/kg Cu. Eine detaillierte Betrachtung zeigt, dass KEA und GWP des importierten Kupfers abhängig von der Bezugsquelle deutlich variieren. Die Bezugsquelle und die mit ihr einhergehenden geologischen und technischen Parameter stellen somit wichtige Einflussfaktoren hinsichtlich des energetischen Aufwands und der Emission von Treibhausgasen dar. Neben den Bezugsquellen spielt auch die Art des importierten Guts, d. h. Kupferkonzentrat oder Kupferkathode, eine Rolle. Der Transportaufwand ist beim Import von Kupferkonzentrat aufgrund dessen geringen Metallgehalts deutlich höher. Unter gleichen technischen Voraussetzungen ist es daher sinnvoll, dass die metallurgische Behandlung möglichst in der Nähe der Minen stattfindet. Dies gilt es jedoch im Einzelfall und unter Berücksichtigung weiterer z. B. rohstoffpolitischer Aspekte zu prüfen."

We provide experimental evidence on child health and human capital outcomes from the longer-term follow-up of a school-based nutrition intervention in India. Using panel data, we examine the effectiveness of the use of iron and iodine fortified salt in school lunches to reduce anemia among school children. After four years of treatment, treated children, on average, have higher hemoglobin levels and a lower likelihood of anemia relative to the control group. Interestingly, the intervention did not have an impact on cognitive and educational outcomes."

      "Distant past experience of economic performance is hypothesized to govern long-run employment performance across 28 European Union (EU) state members. Economic studies usually include lag structure for causality analysis, such as the Wold causal chain and recursive vector autoregression. The inquiry of this paper is different from the literature for two reasons: first, it intends to explain theoretically and empirically how long an influence of significant economic experience in the distant past on long-run unemployment would last. Second, the focus is on the EU due to the ongoing debate over economic integration and independent economies, of which Brexit is one prominent example. Based on panel data, a diagrammatic theory conveys the meaning of the distant past economic experience and its relationship with long-run unemployment in the EU. Empirical investigations include causality tests and long-lasting economic influences, where a new simple approach toward Cholesky decomposition is also demonstrated. The effect of an unexpected shock to inflation on unemployment can remain literally substantive for up to nearly four decades, while unemployment effects of some trade-related innovations can last even longer. The results are supported using analogical reasoning of macroeconomic behaviors incorporated in the original concept of this research."

      "The purpose of this work was to identify critical success factors for lean implementation. It followed two first-time implementations of lean in small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The case studies collectively spanned over four years. It was observed that the real problem with achieving lean success was not management commitment but their ignorance of what they should commit to, hence a knowledge problem. This paper provides new insights into the role of knowledge as a causal factor in the successful implementation of lean and especially in organisations with limited resources. For practitioners, management knowledge needs active consideration in the implementation phase. Management knowledge is particularly significant in SME implementations due to their resource constraints. Researchers still need to define the success factors more explicitly, including the specific management commitments."

      "In diesem Working Paper wird eine Abschätzung des möglichen zukünftigen Bedarfs an landwirtschaftlicher Fläche für den Ausbau von Photovoltaik-Freiflächenanlagen in Deutschland erarbeitet. Für die Abschätzung werden aktuelle politische Ziele sowie verschiedene Energieszenarien betrachtet, um den Bedarf an installierter PV-Leistung in einem vollständig transformierten Energiesystem zu ermitteln. Die benötigte PV-Leistung kann auf verschiedenen Flächen (wie z.B. Dachflächen, Agrarflächen) installiert werden. Wie viele der Anlagen auf landwirtschaftlichen Flächen errichtet werden, hängt von vielen Faktoren ab und kann sich zukünftig sehr unterschiedlich entwickeln. Darüber hinaus wird der zukünftige Flächenbedarf von der spezifischen Flächeninanspruchnahme, also wie viel Fläche je installierter Leistung benötigt wird, beeinflusst. Alle drei Einflussgrößen sind mit einer hohen Unsicherheit behaftet. Als wahrscheinlichste Entwicklung werden das aktuelle politische Ziel von 215 GWp installierter Leistung bis 2030 und von 400 GWp für ein vollständiges transformiertes Energiesystem bis 2040, ein Anteil von 50 % auf landwirtschaftlichen Flächen sowie eine spezifische Flächeninanspruchnahme von 1,4 ha/MWp angenom-men. Darauf basierend ergibt sich eine Flächeninanspruchnahme bei einem transformierten Energiesystem (Jahr 2040) von 280.000 ha. Das entspricht einem Anteil an der aktuell landwirtschaftlich genutzten Fläche von 1,7 %. Die Spannweite aller betrachteten Szenarien liegt zwischen 0,3 % und 4 %, was die hohe Unsicherheit der Prognose aufzeigt.",
      "In this working paper, an estimation of the possible future demand for agricultural land for the expansion of ground-mounted photovoltaic systems in Germany is developed. For the estimation, current political goals as well as different energy scenarios are considered in order to determine the demand for installed PV ca-pacity in a fully transformed energy system. The required PV power can be installed on different areas (e.g. rooftops, agricultural area). The number of installations on agricultural land depends on many factors and can develop very differently in the future. In addition, the future demand for land is influenced by the specific land use, i.e. how much land is needed per installed capacity. All three factors are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The most probable development is assumed to be the current political target of 215 GWp installed capacity by 2030 and for a fully transformed energy system 400 GWp installed capacity by 2040, a share of 50 % on agricultural land and a specific land use of 1.4 ha/MWp. Based on this, the land use for a transformed energy system (year 2040) is 280,000 ha. This corresponds to a share of 1.7 % of the currently agricultural used area. The range of all scenarios considered is between 0.3 % and 4 %, which shows the high uncertainty of the forecast."

      "Several U.S. states have attempted to use of legal liability imposed on greenhouse gas emitters as a public policy instrument for climate change. This brief comment considers the desirability of this approach, focusing on three possible roles for climate change liability: as a source of compensation, as a direct influence on greenhouse gas concentrations, and as a means to facilitate the adoption of ex ante public policies to control greenhouse gases. The strongest argument for liability may be that the threat of liability improves the chances that climate change policies will use more efficient, revenue-raising instruments."

      "This paper aims to identify the potential influence of financial literacy's marginal change on households' income (wealth) inequality levels both at the mean value and along with the distribution value. Using data from the Bank of Italy Survey of Households Income and Wealth (SHIW)'s 2016 wave - which includes the Big Three questions, a widely used measure of financial literacy - we show that replacing 10% of respondents reporting no correct answers with respondents reporting two correct answers out of three correct answers would increase the mean value of the household equivalized disposable income by 0.8% (160€ per year). Additionally, the mean value would increase by +1.5% (285€ per year) if we replace 10% of respondents reporting no correct answers with those reporting three correct answers. These results are not trivial. A lump sum leading to the same household income increase would cost on average EUR 4.1 to 7.3 billion per year in Italy. Finally, heterogeneous analysis reveals that an increase in financial literacy levels is expected to have different outcomes across the population, engendering often a greater reduction of inequality levels among the most vulnerable groups. As a natural policy implication, our results strongly support mandatory financial education in schools."

      "The research paper assesses the opportunities and challenges raised by the post-crisis EU governance system with regard to the transition of European economies towards a new growth model balancing economic performance with social cohesion and environmental responsibility. It begins with questioning the term of ‘governance’ and with a hint at the 'multi-level governance' literature available in EU studies. This section suggests that the EU's nature is one of multiple and innovative policymaking methods. Any assessment of the EU's added value must investigate the actual policy direction and the effectiveness of a complex EU governance architecture, by looking in particular at how EMU coordination frameworks interacts with Community-based policies. The paper focuses then on the goals, the processes and the financial instruments underpinning the Europe 2020 Strategy, bearing in mind the limits encountered by the Lisbon Strategy during the last decade. It finds that the Strategy, albeit carefully balanced, does not avoid the risk of a 'capability-expectations' gap. Implementation would gain, on the one side, from more consistent legal and financial instruments at EU level, and from a more supportive macroeconomic environment in the euro area on the other. The third section examines the way in which Europe 2020 cohabits with other frameworks of coordination within the European Semester, such as the reformed Stability and Growth Pact, and the new Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure. Potential clashes between diverging objectives and their legal bases are identified and tested against the views of practitioners (8 interviews were conducted in parallel to the research) and throughout a case-study based on how the Semester has so far impacted on three countries: Finland, France and Italy. The European Commission's Annual Growth Surveys for 2011, 2012 and 2013 are also analysed. This research reveals a prioritisation of fiscal consolidation and short-term, market-based adjustment policies over the longer-term objectives pursued by the Europe 2020 Strategy. The collective outcome of these policies, and the impact of national reforms on the whole EU, tend to be overlooked as well. Nevertheless, there is substantial room for manoeuvre and dialogue between the Commission and individual countries. The paper concludes that ways should be found to shield Europe 2020 objectives from overwhelming stability considerations in the Euro Area, and contains some suggestions for further innovations of governance in that respect. A greater differentiation between countries according to their position might be necessary. The conclusion also argues that it fells to national governments, parliaments and parties to seize the opportunity of the European Semester to frame challenges differently and to push for alternative solutions."

      "Employing a sample of Spanish municipalities from the Madrid region for the period 2010-2019, we study the influence of a politician's sex on political budget cycles (PBCs). The Madrid region is subject to a homogenous set of budget rules, which allows consistently categorising budget expenditure items as either 'mandatory' or 'non-mandatory' public services. Differentiating between four sizes of municipalities, the gender influence is studied along two dimensions: mayor's sex and share of women in government. Except for the largest municipalities, we discover significant evidence of PBC-related changes, ranging between 3% and 7% of average municipal budgets, in mandatory spending for both sexes. The impact is roughly twice as large in the long term. On average, male and female mayors tend to increase pre-electoral mandatory spending, even when the government is gender balanced. However, in the (rare) case of female-dominated governments, mayors do not appear to engage in PBC-related activities, and may even decrease mandatory spending, before an election."

      "This paper presents a macroeconomic approach to sustainable growth. After clarifying the concept of sustainability, the interdependence between natural resources and accumulated capital stocks such as physical, human, and knowledge capital is discussed. The conditions for the substitution process leading to sustainable development are demonstrated in a one-sector approach and two versions of a multi-sector endogenous growth model. It turns out that prices of natural inputs have their major impact on growth by changing an economy's sectoral structure. The prediction of a successful substitution of knowledge for natural resources emerges to be realistic, provided that the sectoral adjustment cost in the economy are not too high."

      "This paper considers the impacts of agro-industry development and international trade on income distribution in Myanmar, focusing on low-income rural households. We use a social accounting matrix multiplier (SAM) decomposition model featuring detailed economic linkages. After describing the Myanmar economy through the lens of a SAM for 2017, we focus on agriculture development. Our results suggest that low-income rural households benefit considerably from exogenous increases in crop and agro-processing activities. A full decomposition of the multipliers indicates that low-income rural farming households link strongly to agro-processing, mainly through spillover and feedback effects. However, agro-processing is at a low level of development in Myanmar. We then consider international trade, which reveals high rates of import leakages and that broad export improvement would benefit low-income rural farm households more than other households. This suggests that investment in agro-processing value chain development would be beneficial overall and particularly for low-income rural households."

      "We examine educational transmission between fathers (mothers) and daughters in India for daughters born during 1962-1991. We find that educational persistence, as measured by the regression coefficient of father's (mother's) education as a predictor of daughter's education, has declined over time. However, the correlation between educational attainment of daughters and fathers (mothers), another commonly used measure of persistence, suggests only a marginal decline. Further decomposing the intergenerational correlation, we find that although persistence has declined at the lower end of the fathers' (mothers') educational distribution, it has been compensated by an increase in persistence at other parts of fathers' (mothers') educational distribution. We also find that \"Equality of Opportunity\" remains an elusive goal for India. Not only the probability of a daughter attaining senior secondary or above education (top end of educational distribution) is positively associated with father's (mother's) education levels, the gaps in those probabilities do not show any sign of convergence. Similarly, there is no sign of any convergence in the probability of a daughter attaining senior secondary or above education even with the same level of father's (mother's) education between Higher Hindu Castes' daughters and daughters belonging to disadvantaged groups such as Other Backward Castes or Scheduled Castes/Tribes."

      "Using recent pooled data from several developed nations, the paper uniquely examines whether the composition of payment instruments has a bearing on the prevalence of corruption in a country. Our results suggest that the choice of instruments matters. Paper credit transfer transactions are consis-tently associated with corrupt activities, while credit card transactions tend to reduce them. Cheques generally increase corruption, the results with respect to nonpaper credit transfers are mixed, while direct debits fail to show significant effects on corruption. These findings hold for alternative corruption measures and when allowance is made for endogeneity of payment instruments."

The mining boom after 1999 provided the authorities with significant lessons and opportunities associated with managing natural resource wealth. The present paper additionally examines some of the specific policy and regulatory decisions taken since 2015, and tries to assess how the multiple challenges of new natural gas wealth are being addressed. It concludes that the experience thus far is not encouraging."

      "We analyze the technical efficiency of German and Swiss urban public transport companies by means of SFA. In transport networks we might face different network structures or complexities, not observed, but influencing the production process. The unobserved factors are typically modeled as separable factors. However, we argue that the entire production process is organized around different network structures. Therefore, they are inevitably non-separable from the observed inputs and outputs. The adopted econometric model is a random coefficient stochastic frontier model. We estimate an input distance function for the years 1991 to 2006. The results underline the presence of unobserved non-separable factors."

      "This study investigates the effect of inequality on female employment in 42 countries in sub- Saharan Africa for the period 2004-2014. Three inequality indicators are used, namely, the: Gini coefficient, Atkinson index and Palma ratio. Two indicators of gender inclusion are also employed, namely: female employment and female unemployment rates. The empirical analysis is based on the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM).The following main findings are established. First, inequality increases female unemployment in regressions based on the Palma ratio. Second, from the robustness checks, inequality reduces female employment within the frameworks of the Gini coefficient and Palma ratio."

      "The first part of this paper analyzes the impact of horizontal mergers of suppliers or retailers on their respective bargaining power. In contrast to previous approaches, we suppose that parties resolve the bargaining problem efficiently. Moreover, by ensuring that demand is independent at all retailers we exclude monopolization effects. We find that downstream mergers are more likely (less likely) if suppliers have increasing (decreasing) unit costs, while upstream mergers are more likely (less likely) if goods are substitutes (complements). In both cases a merger enables the involved parties to gain access to inframarginal rents. In the second part of the paper we explore how the role of bargaining power affects technology choice under different market structures. We isolate two effects. First, if retailers are non-integrated, suppliers focus disproportionately more on inframarginal cost reduction. Second, this bias is mitigated if goods are substitutes and suppliers are non-integrated as competition exerts a disciplining force.",
      "Der erste Teil des Aufsatzes zeigt, wie sich horizontale Zusammenschlüsse zwischen Produzenten und Einzelhändlern auf die Verhandlungsmacht der Vertragsparteien auswirken. Im Gegensatz zu vorhergehenden Ansätzen nehmen wir an, daß die Parteien ihre Verhandlungsprobleme effizient lösen. Des weiteren unterstellen wir, daß die Einzelhändler Märkte bedienen, die unabhängig voneinander sind, wodurch Monopolisierungsvorteile ausgeschlossen werden. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, daß Einzelhändler einen Zusammenschluß favorisieren, wenn die Stückkosten der Produzenten mit zunehmender Ausbringungsmenge ansteigen. Umgekehrt sind die gemeinsamen Gewinne unabhängiger Einzelhändler höher als bei einem Zusammenschluß, wenn die Stückkosten der Produzenten fallend verlaufen. Die Produzenten können ihre gemeinsamen Gewinne durch eine Fusion steigern, wenn ihre Erzeugnisse substituierbar sind. Stehen die Güter der Produzenten in einem komplementären Verhältnis zueinander, so ist ein Zusammenschluß nicht vorteilhaft. Diese Ergebnisse sind unabhängig von der Struktur der anderen Marktseite. Allgemein gilt sowohl für die Produzenten als auch für die Einzelhändler, daß ein Zusammenschluß den Zugriff auf inframarginale Renten der anderen Marktseite ermöglicht. Im zweiten Teil der Arbeit untersuchen wir, wie die Berücksichtigung von Verhandlungsmacht die Technologiewahl eines Produzenten bei unterschiedlichen Marktstrukturen beeinflußt. Wir können zwei Effekte isolieren. (1) Produzenten haben einen Anreiz Kosteneinsparungen bei inframarginalen Ausbringungsmengen zu Lasten von höheren Gesamtkosten zu tauschen, wenn die Einzelhändler nicht zusammengeschlossen sind. (2) Diese Verzerrung hin zu einer ineffizienten Technologiewahl wird abgemildert, wenn die Güter substituierbar sind und die Produzenten unabhängig agieren, weil Konkurrenz eine disziplinierende Funktion ausübt."

      "The management of congestion within the German electricity transmission network has become more important during the last years. This emerging relevance is caused by the increase of renewable generation and the partial phaseout of nuclear power plants. Both developments yield a change in the transmission flow pattern and thus the need for congestion management. Currently, four German transmission system operators (TSOs) are in charge of managing congestion using curative methods, particularly re-dispatch of power plants. However, the existence of four TSOs within Germany induces the question whether coordination between them in managing national congestion would be beneficial. To address this issue, we apply a generalized Nash equilibrium model to analyze different degrees of coordination, covering the German electricity market with a detailed representation of the generation and network structure. Our results indicate that the costs of congestion management decrease in a rising degree of coordination as TSOs take into account congestion in other operators' zones. Total costs are highest in case each TSO is solely responsible for its own zone, and lowest if one integrated entity is in charge of mitigating congestion. We conclude that, in a setup with multiple TSOs, inducing coordination, for instance through a common market, has the potential of lowering the overall costs of congestion management."

      "Steuervergünstigungen sind breitenwirksam einsetzbare und potenziell effiziente Instrumente der Förderung und instrumentellen Unterstützung zahlreicher Politikfelder, beispielsweise in der Verkehrspolitik, der Wohnungspolitik, der Umweltpolitik sowie für viele sektorale oder Querschnittsaufgaben der Wirtschaftspolitik. Zugleich verlangen steuerliche Subventionen wegen ihrer Budgetferne sowie ihrer Tendenz zu Langlebigkeit und Mitnahmeeffekten die besondere Wachsamkeit einer verstärkt auf Ergebnisorientierung und Evidenzbasierung aufbauenden politischen Steuerung Für diesen Anspruch liefert die große Evaluierung von 33 deutschen Steuervergünstigungen die wissenschaftliche Grund- lage. Im Auftrag des Bundesministeriums der Finanzen haben 2017 bis 2019 das ZEW Mannheim, das Ifo Institut, das Fraunhofer FIT sowie federführend das FiFo Köln gemeinsam steuerliche Subventionen im Umfang von zusammen rund 7,4 Milliarden Euro quantifiziert und nach einem einheitlichen Mus- ter tiefgehend evaluiert.",
      "Tax benefits (or 'tax expenditures') are important, broadly applicable and potentially efficient instruments for creating Incentives for private activities and for promoting numerous policy objectives (for example in transport policy, housing policy, environmental policy and many sectoral or horizontal ar- eas of economic policy). At the same time, because they are not included in government budgets, have a tendency towards longevity and are susceptible to deadweight effects, tax benefits must be monitored with particular vigilance as part of a results-oriented and evidence-based governance process. To obtain a scientific basis for conducting this governance task, the Federal Ministry of Finance commissioned a large- scale evaluation of 33 German tax benefits. Conducted jointly by re-searchers at the FiFo Institute for Public, the Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW), the Ifo Institute, and the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology (FIT), the study uses a standardized framework to evaluate tax subsidies that add up to a total of roughly €7.4 billion."

      "This paper examines the extent to which agglomeration of the hospital service industry enhances the productivity of producing health care. Specifically, we use a large set of private insurance claims from the FAIR Health database to show that an increasing spatial concentration of hospital services results in a decreased cost of obtaining intermediate medical services. We explicitly test whether the reduced cost at concentrated locations arises from the ability to share intermediate service providers. The identification relies on state variation in medical lab technician licensure requirements, which influence the cost of intermediate services only through the cost of running a lab. Our findings suggest that agglomeration of the hospital service industry attracts specialized medical labs, which in turn help to reduce the cost of producing laboratory tests."

      "High levels of employment protection reduce hiring and firing and have a theoretically ambiguous effect on the employment level. Immigrants, being new to the labor market, may be less aware of employment protection regulations and less likely to claim their rights, which may create a gap between the costs for employers of hiring a native relative to hiring an immigrant. This paper tests that hypothesis drawing on evidence for the EU and on two natural experiments for Spain and Italy. The results suggest that strict employment protection legislation (EPL) gives immigrants a comparative advantage relative to natives. Stricter EPL is found to reduce employment and reduce hiring and firing rates for natives. By contrast, stricter EPL has no effect on most immigrants and may even increase employment rates for those who have been in the country for a longer time."

      "Information affecting a candidate's reputation might have significant electoral consequences. Do candidates respond to the release of information? Using Brazilian elections and audits as an exogenous source of information, I show that both incumbent and challenger increase their campaign spending when detrimental information affects the incumbent's reputation. Conversely, beneficial information decreases candidates' spending. The main channel is that information affects the expected competitiveness of elections and, therefore, candidates' spending. Only information disclosed prior to electoral campaigns impacts campaign spending. Furthermore, incumbents also adapt a conditional cash transfers program by increasing (decreasing) the beneficiaries when detrimental (beneficial) reputation shocks occur."

It concludes with predictions of future trends."

      "Im August 2021 wird die deutsche Inflationsrate voraussichtlich auf 3,9 % steigen. Ein Teil davon dürfte einmaligen oder vorübergehenden Effekten geschuldet sein. Hierzu zählen in Deutschland vor allem die Rücknahme der Mehrwertsteuersenkung, die Ausweitung der CO2-Bepreisung sowie Preisanstiege durch die Knappheit von Rohstoffen und Vorprodukten. Dennoch mag es strukturelle Gründe für eine steigende Inflation geben. So werden zum Teil die lockere Geldpolitik und das neue Inflationsziel der EZB für höhere Inflationsrisiken verantwortlich gemacht. Außerdem führt die expansive Fiskalpolitik der neuen US-Administration zu höheren Preissteigerungsraten in den USA. Ob die Möglichkeit einer Lohn-Preis-Spirale besteht und ob die Inflationsmessung verbesserungsfähig ist, wird ebenfalls im Rahmen dieses Zeitgesprächs diskutiert.",
      "In August 2021, the German inflation rate is expected to rise to 3.9 %. Part of this is likely due to one-off effects. In Germany, these include above all the reversal of the VAT cut, the expansion of CO2 pricing and price increases due to the scarcity of raw materials and intermediate products. Nevertheless, there may also be structural reasons for rising inflation. For example, the loose monetary policy and the ECB's new inflation target are partly to blame for higher inflation risks. In addition, the expansive fiscal policy of the new Biden administration is leading to higher rates of price increases in the US. Other aspects, the possibility of a wage-price spiral and whether inflation is measured correctly at all, will also be discussed in this Zeitgespräch."

Time and management induced technical change are then defined interms of these general indices. For comparison, we also consider models in which time and management are specified as continuous variables.

      "According to the compensation theory, market forces should assure a complete compensation of the initial labour-saving impact of process innovations. In this paper a critique of this approach is proposed through a detailed survey of the theoretical and empirical literature on the subject. The general conclusion is that - although compensation is always working - the complete counter-balancing of dismissed workers cannot be assumed ex-ante."

      "Child care subsidies play a critical role in facilitating the transition of disadvantaged mothers from welfare to work. However, little is known about the influence of these policies on children's health and well-being. In this paper, we study the impact of subsidy receipt on low-income children's weight outcomes in the fall and spring of kindergarten. The goals of our empirical analysis are twofold. We first utilize standard OLS and fixed effects methods to explore body mass index as well as measures of overweight and obesity. We then turn to quantile regression to address the possibility that subsidy receipt has heterogeneous effects on children's weight at different points in the BMI distribution. Results suggest that subsidy receipt is associated with increases in BMI and a greater likelihood of being overweight and obese. We also find substantial variation in subsidy effects across the BMI distribution. In particular, child care subsidies have no effect on BMI at the lower end of the distribution, inconsistent effects in the middle of the distribution, and large effects at the top of the distribution. Our results point to the use of non-parental child care, particularly centerbased services, as the key mechanism through which subsidies influence children's weight outcomes."

      "Social contracts share reciprocal rights, obligations and responsibilities regarding our environment and our responses to climate change. The recent pandemic creates opportunities to rethink these existing and evolving social contracts and make changes regarding risk management and the need to build a better program of resilience in the face of change and uncertainty. This paper is about resilience thinking. We discuss how the capacity to recover from difficulties may be improved. Examples include the impact potential of Spekboom in South Africa; Pinus Radiate in New Zealand, the Empress tree and the treasury of plants and products from revolutionary science already underway. Social -ecological system elasticity and examine insights on creating resilience in a warming world. Focus is on social rearrangement and activity that may enhance responses to ecosystem change, yet unusual weather events, and the consequences of some social-ecological changes already undertaken around the world. Examples include changes adopted in the McKenzie River Valley, the grasslands in Romania, a novel weighted index of spatial resilience for Spanish olive landscapes; and the future potential from the European eLTER project. The harvest from resilience thinking provides valuable insight for the social ecological thinker and ways to build resilience and social security in a warming world."

      "The dividend payout problem in literature has largely been misspecified. The roles of dividends as signals, agency cost reducers, fixed income providers or even the invariance of dividend payouts are all phenomenon that, based on market conditions, follow from the role of dividends as equalizers of firm value, discounted from a given point in time, across firm's life. In this study, I discuss few problems with prevalent approaches towards solving dividend puzzle in academia, provide justification for the aforementioned hypothesis based on few assumptions, derive a model applicable under ideal conditions and then measure the deviations from the ideal model in two market indices-Nifty 500 (India) and S&P 500 (USA). The results obtained are then compared with the studies already done on these market and the reasons for deviation are discussed. Once the dividend model is derived, all roles of dividend flow automatically from the primary role of dividends and the extent of efficacy of each of the secondary role is based on numerous factors which vary, giving different results across different studies. The empirical investigation gives a view of these different factors at work in the markets."

      "This paper argues that the level of financial services provision determines the risk management strategies among the poor. The paper estimates the determinants of the household's use of one, two or all three types of microfinancial services applying ordered probit models and additionally probit models for combinations of them. By doing this on household survey data from Sri Lanka, there is empirical evidence that household's probability to participate in microfinancial services increases with rising self perception towards risk. Further, we find that it depends highly on the type of risk, if a household is more or less likely to use microfinancial services in Sri Lanka, whereas the accessibility to one, two or three microfinancial services is determined by the experience of specific hazards in the past. The study finds that the poor are less likely to use microfinancial services than their better off counterparts."

We find that if productivity at the firm level tends to positively react to increased import competition, the multi-product firms response varies according to the relative importance of the product that faces stronger import competition in the firm’s product portfolio. When import competition associated to the main product of a firm increases, the firm tend to increase its efficiency in producing that core product, in which it has a productivity advantage. However, when the degree of foreign competition increases for non core products of a firm, it tends to lower its efficiency in producing those goods."

      "This paper examines the causal effect of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) on bank productivity (Q) in 23 European Union countries and the short- and long-term relationship among fixed assets (k1), liquid assets (k2), and labour (L) over the period 1990-2013 for a sample of 156 commercial banks, of which 60 entities have acquired at least one other entity. Granger causality tests on our results reveal unidirectional causality from liquid assets to fixed assets. However, the causality between K2 and L is unobservable, and the linkage between fixed assets and labour is bidirectional. The error correction term (ECT) is negative and statistically significant for all models, which denotes the presence of bidirectional relationship among all selected variables and long-term unidirectional causality from mergers and acquisitions to bank productivity. Our long-term dynamic panel estimates indicate that the strategic fit of mergers and acquisitions has the potential to create long-term productivity improvement."

      "This paper starts out by pointing out the challenges and weaknesses which the German banking systems faces according to the prevailing views among national and international observers. These challenges include a general problem of profitability and, possibly as its main reason, the strong role of public banks. These concerns raise the questions whether the facts support this assessment of a general profitability problem and whether there are reasons to expect a fundamental or structural transformation of the German banking system. The paper contains four sections. The first one presents the evidence concerning the profitability problem in a comparative, international perspective. The second section presents information about the so-called three-pillar system of German banking. What might be surprising in this context is that the group of pub lic banks is not only the largest segment of the German banking system, but that the primary savings banks also are its financially most successful part. The German banking system is highly fragmented. This fact suggests to discuss past, present and possible future consolidations in the banking system in the third section. The authors provide evidence to the effect that within- group consolidation has been going on at a rapid pace in the public and the cooperative banking groups in recent years and that this development has not yet come to an end, while within-group consolid ation among the large private banks, consolidation across group boundaries at a national level and cross-border or international consolidation has so far only happened at a limited scale, and do not appear to gain momentum in the near future. In the last section, the authors develop their explanation for the fact that large-scale and cross border consolidation has so far not materialized to any great extent. Drawing on the concept of complementarity, they argue that it would be difficult to expect these kinds of mergers and acquisitions happening within a financial system which is itself surprisingly stable, or, as one cal also call it, resistant to change."

      "A rationale for providing support to the farm sector in the course of economic development and structural change is a growing gap between the incomes of nonagricultural workers and the incomes of farmers. Drawing on a model that enables us to analyze the level of social stress experienced by farmers as employment shifts from the farm sector to other sectors, we find that even without an increasing gap between the incomes of non-agricultural workers and the incomes of farmers, support to farmers might be needed/can be justified. This result arises because under well-specified conditions, when the size of the farm population decreases, those who remain in farming experience increasing aggregate social stress. The increase is nonlinear: it is modest when the outflow from the farm sector is relatively small or when it is large, and it becomes more significant when the outflow is moderate. This finding can inform policymakers who seek to alleviate the social stress of the farming population as to the timing and intensity of that intervention."

      "Drawing on the 2013 Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) and complementary administrative data sources, we simulate household balance sheets at the micro level for the 2005-14 period. We use this dataset to tell the story of household leveraging and deleveraging over a tumultuous period for the Irish economy. We show that deleveraging has proceeded at a signficantly faster pace for older households, when compared with younger age groups. In contrast, we find t hat a higher-incidence of t racker mortgages amongst younger borrowers - which passed through the historically low ECB policy rates since 2009 - relative to older borrowers has played a major role in easing the debt repayment burden in the presence of large income shocks. Notwithstanding historically low interest rates, we show that income shocks are the main factor contributing to mortgage repayment problems. However, there is also a role for equity factors."

      "We conduct a large-scale survey experiment in nine European countries to study how priming a major crisis (COVID-19), common economic interests, and a shared identity influences altruism, reciprocity and trust of EU citizens. We find that priming the COVID-19 pandemic increases altruism and reciprocity towards compatriots, citizens of other EU countries, and non-EU citizens. Priming common European values also boosts altruism and reciprocity but only towards compatriots and fellow Europeans. Priming common economic interests has no tangible impact on behaviour. Trust in others is not affected by any treatment. Our results are consistent with the parochial altruism hypothesis, which asserts that because altruism arises out of inter-group conflict, humans show a tendency to favor members of their own groups."

      "Attempts to regulate the temporary employment sector have had mixed results internationally. In South Africa, temporary employment was regulated in 2015 through amendments to the Labour Relations Act. This paper uses administrative data to examine the short-term impact of strengthening employment protection legislation in the temporary employment services (TES) sector, focusing on employment, job duration, and wages. A regression discontinuity design is used as the amendments applied only to employees earning below a certain threshold. The findings suggest that while working conditions improved for those that transitioned out of the TES sector into the non-TES sector, a larger proportion of individuals moved out of the data into informal employment, unemployment, or economic inactivity after the amendments were implemented. Providing empirical evidence on the impact of the amendments is an important contribution to the debate on regulating labour markets in developing countries, particularly in South Africa given its considerable unemployment rate."

      "This paper uses 1985-1999 manufacturing census data for old Russian enterprises to calculate the magnitude and productivity effects of gross job flow rates before and after reforms. Job creation was low throughout the period in this sector, but increased slightly during the transition, while job destruction rose markedly. Heterogeneity in firm employment change also increased significantly. Intra- and inter-sectoral job reallocation had no effect on aggregate labor productivity during the socialist period, while they have made a strong positive contribution during the transition. Privatization and product market competition have not led to greater job destruction overall, but rather have helped to focus the destruction in the firms with the lowest productivity."

      "Purpose: The years 1960-1970 were decisive years in the development of Swiss vocational education and training (VET). The post-World War II economic boom, technological innovations and the debate concerning equal opportunities and the democratisation of education put the VET system under pressure. Reforms were thus undertaken to increase the attractiveness of the system and to respond to the urgent shortage of qualified workers at the time. At the same time, reforms were adopted increasing the theoretical and general knowledge content of VET and improving the quality of training. The aim of our article is to describe these reforms and to show how they relate to a certain image of the future of society. Method: Our article is based on an analysis of historical documents written between 1960 and 1972 in Switzerland on the subject of VET. These documents will, firstly, be used for a historical reconstruction of the situation and of the major challenges of the time; and secondly, they will be subjected to a discourse analysis in order to identify the main arguments that characterised the public debate at the time. Results: Our article shows how the reforms undertaken take shape on the basis of a certain image of the future of society and of VET held at the time: an image characterised by constant and rapid changes, increasing insecurity, need for adaptation and flexibility, complexification and specialisation of the work tasks. Conclusion: The article will also underline how the responses to the challenges posed by this image of the future will be at the origin of five trends that will characterise the evolution of Swiss VET until today: a trend towards academisation, with more academic and general content; a trend towards pedagogisation, with increased pedagogical attention to curricula and teacher training; differentiation, with the creation of new certifications; permeability, with the opening of vocational tracks to higher education; and \"learnerisation\", with the gradual change of the figure of the apprentice from a \"worker\" to a \"learner\". Far from being limited to the evolution of Swiss VET, these five trends describe movements that recent studies by CEDEFOP show also at the European level."

      "This paper investigates the intergenerational mobility with regard to people's decision to work in the U.S. financial industry over the last 47 years. I present evidence that children of fathers who worked in the financial industry during their childhood are about 8 percentage points more likely to work in finance themselves. This increase in likelihood is greater than in most other industries and is driven solely by wealthier families. In addition, I document that second-generation finance industry employees whose fathers already worked in finance enjoy a substantial income surplus compared to their industry peers."

      "Approximately ten years after the Lisbon Treaty came into force, the debate on reforming the European Union has reached new heights. A decade of 'poly-crisis' has rattled long-held certitudes. At the same time, phenomena such as Brexit, a new European Commission, a new European Parliament, and potentially threatening extra-legal developments as diverse as authoritarian populism and climate change have culminated in a moment suggesting an indeterminate future from which much seems possible - even stasis. In the run-up to the next Lisbon decade, EU law scholarship, especially its German variant, must face up to the task of not only commenting on the development of Union law, but also of helping to shape it. However, before shooting aimlessly at amorphous clouds of ideas, it is certainly worthwhile considering the preconditions for reflecting upon the future of the European Union. This second order systematization can then be supplemented with substance by identifying structurally significant fields of reflection of relevance for the future of European integration."

      "Purpose: A primary requirement of Industry 4.0 and realization of Cyber-Physical Systems in production and logistics is the dynamic connection of physical and digital components. Service-oriented Architectures are a well established approach to meet this requirement. However, a service discovery using syntactic descriptions of services limits efficient application of a Service-oriented Architecture concerning the complexity and variability of existing processes. Methodology: A semantics based mechanism for service discovery can solve this limitation. It uses an ontology management system containing a domain specific ontology and modelling specific Cyber-Physical Systems as individuals. SPARQL Protocol And RDF Query Language (SPARQL) queries searching this ontology with context-related parameters. A use case demonstrates the mechanism by realizing an in-house transport request. Findings: A syntax based service discovery requires a definition and publishing of unique service names. However, complex Cyber-Physical Systems using multiple parameters during service calls require disproportionate effort to implement and maintain these names. A semantics based service discovery considers various parameters by using a specific ontology calling services by their properties without knowing the service name. Originality: A semantics based is decoupled from specific service implementations of components in a Cyber-Physical Systems. Therefore, an explicit specification of parameter configurations in service descriptions is not necessary. A Service-oriented Architecture can be implemented in complex systems without extensive adjustments or coordination mechanisms."

      "In October 1999, the British government enacted the Working Families? Tax Credit, a generous tax credit aimed at encouraging work among low-income families with children. This paper uses longitudinal data collected between 1991 and 2001 to evaluate the effect of this reform on single mothers. We identify this impact by comparing changes in behavior of lone mothers to changes for single women without children. Our results show that the financial incentives of the reform had powerful effects on a wide range of lone mothers? decisions. The reform led to a substantial increase in employment rates of about 7 percentage points, which was driven by both higher rates at which lone mothers remained in the labor force and higher rates at which they entered it. Women?s responses were highly heterogeneous, with larger effects for mothers with one pre-school aged child, and virtually no effect for mothers with multiple older children. The reform also led to significant reductions in single mothers? subsequent fertility and in the rate at which they married. Our findings suggest that the generous childcare tax credit component of the reform played a key role in explaining the estimated employment responses. Finally, we find relatively large behavioral effects in anticipation of the actual reform, which emphasizes the importance of allowing for such effects in future evaluation research."

      "This paper focuses on a neglected—horizontal—dimension of social stratification. It examines the patterns of social differentiation in the Visegrád countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) and attempts to assess changes in the social structure at the subnational level. Social structure changes are explained within the context of broader socio-economic development. The main analyses performed in this study are based on EUSILC micro-data covering 2006–2016 and offer a comprehensive perspective on the patterns of social-stratification development at the regional level utilising three dimensions: social class (proxied by the European Social-Economic Classification), highest attained education level, and income. The results indicate different trajectories in social differentiation across the four countries, although some of the patterns identified are similar. The results indicate that the working class is shrinking and the salariat is growing, and that there are declining shares of people with at most primary or secondary education and increasing numbers with tertiary education. Income inequalities remained relatively stable over the observed period across the Czech and Slovak regions, but fluctuated in Hungarian regions, and the initially greater income inequalities in Polish regions have tended to decline over time. The findings suggest that the least favourable patterns in the development of regional social differentiation are found in the Hungarian regions."

      "The Agricultural Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (ACEF) is an ongoing loan and grant program in the Philippines for agriculture and fisheries. From the start of its actual implementation in 2000 up to the present, it has been plagued by numerous problems which significantly derailed the attainment of its objectives. Because of this, its implementation was suspended in 2011 and an evaluation was conducted in line with the zero-based budgeting (ZBB) approach of the national government. As the output of the evaluation, this study reviewed the ACEF program, identified and analyzed the fund management and other pressing problems and issues it is facing, and provided options as well as specific recommendations for effectively addressing them. The study concluded that since ACEF is a big public expenditure item, it is imperative for the national government to immediately act on its numerous problems by implementing positive changes. It argued that without meaningful reforms, ACEF may just go down as one of the greatest national program failures in recent memory."

      "In this paper we analyse household income mobility dynamics among Africans in South Africa?s most populous province, Kwazulu-Natal, between 1993 and 1998. Compared to industrialized and most developing countries, mobility has been quite high, as might have been expected after the transition in South Africa. This finding is robust when measurement error is controlled for. When disaggregating the sources of mobility, we find that demographic changes and employment changes account for a most of the mobility observed which is related to rapidly shifting household boundaries and a very volatile labour market in an environment of high unemployment. Using a multivariate analysis, we see that transitory incomes play a large role. We also find four types of poverty traps, associated with large initial household size, poor initial education, poor initial asset endowment and poor initial employment access that dominate the otherwise observed regression towards to the mean."

      "Das heutige System der sozialen Mindestsicherung verhindert in Deutschland die Ausbildung eines Niedriglohnsektors. Dies ist eine wesentliche Ursache für die hohe Arbeitslosigkeit Geringqualifizierter. Dieser Beitrag stellt zwei häufig genannte Maßnahmen zur Überwindung sozialstaatlicher Beschäftigungsschwellen einander gegenüber. Am Beispiel eines aktuellen, symptomorientierten Vorschlags für Lohnsubventionen durch Absenkung der Arbeitnehmerbeiträge zur Sozialversicherung auf niedrige Einkommen wird gezeigt, dass Förderung kleiner Markteinkommen durch Kombilöhne die Erwerbsbeteiligung nur unwesentlich erhöht. Zugleich können Mitnahmeeffekte entstehen, mit denen unerwünschte Arbeitszeitwirkungen und hohe fiskalische Kosten verbunden sind. Ein alternativer, ursachenorientierter Ansatz ist die Senkung des sozialen Leistungsniveaus durch Workfare. Eine Abschätzung des Einkommenspotenzials von Transferbeziehern auf Grundlage des Sozio-ökonomischen Panels veranschaulicht, dass sich mit der Verpflichtung erwerbsfähiger Sozialhilfeempfänger zu sozial nützlicher Arbeit bei unverändertem Niveau der sozialen Mindestsicherung deutlich positive Beschäftigungseffekte erzielen lassen.",
      "The German system of generous subsistence payments to the unemployed generates disincentives for labor supply, preventing employment at low wages. This creates substantial unemployment of the low-skilled. This paper discusses the quantitative effects of two frequent proposals to overcome the work barriers set up by the welfare state. Using a recent concept of raising in-work income through cutting social insurance contributions at low earnings as an example, we illustrate that wage subsidies have negligible impact on labor force participation. In addition, the policy might have costly side effects, as it creates parttime incentives beyond the target group of the low qualified. As an alternative, we assess the labor market impact of a workfare strategy. The potential wages of transfer recipients, estimated on the basis of the German Socio-Economic Panel, suggest that combining social transfers with the obligation to work could substantially improve labor market performance of the employable low-skilled."

      "This paper seeks to examine the interdependence between economic growth (EG) and human development (HD). It is concerned with changes in per capita income and its two-way relationship with the basic societal objective of human development. Regressions across various Latin American countries are run for 1960-92. Country performance is separated into virtuous/vicious cycles or HD/EG lopsidedness. The study makes an attempt to correct the commonly held view that ensuring increases in economic growth automatically leads to advances in human development. Human development has to occur prior to or simultaneous with improvements in economic growth, if a country is to reach a virtuous cycle. The Latin American experience indicates that a balanced approach to development has to be adopted. It is imperative to focus on human development from the outset of any reform program, as policies that emphasize economic growth alone are futile in sustaining high levels of human development."

      "We revisit the economic models of social learning by assuming that individuals update their beliefs in a non-Bayesian way. Individuals either overweigh or underweigh (in Bayesian terms) their private information relative to the public information revealed by the decisions of others and each individual's updating rule is private information. First, we consider a setting with perfectly rational individuals with a commonly known distribution of updating rules. We show that introducing heterogeneous updating rules in a simple social learning environment reconciles equilibrium predictions with laboratory evidence. Additionally, a model of social learning with bounded private beliefs and sufficiently rich updating rules corresponds to a model of social learning with unbounded private beliefs. A straightforward implication is that heterogeneity in updating rules is efficiency-enhancing in most social learning environments. Second, we investigate the implications of heterogeneous updating rules in social learning environments where individuals only understand the relation between the aggregate distribution of decisions and the state of the world. Unlike in rational social learning, heterogeneous updating rules do not lead to a substantial improvement of the societal welfare and there is always a non-negligible likelihood that individuals become extremely and wrongly confident about the state of the world"

      "This study empirically explores whether the propensity to offshore affects the total domestic employment at the firm level. The analysis is based on a Finnish weighted sample of 652 firms and screens the effect of offshoring different kinds of tasks. Two main channels of offshoring tasks are taken into account: offshore outsourcing and in-house offshoring. The main conclusion is that offshoring can significantly affect the total domestic employment but that the significance and the direction of the effect depend on which kind of offshoring is involved. Our results offer evidence that in both the manufacturing and service sectors offshore outsourcing of services has a positive effect on employment. In addition it was found that the effect of R&D offshoring on the probability to anticipate an increase of total domestic employment depends on the offshoring channel. Offshore outsourcing of R&D has a positive effect on the anticipated domestic employment, whereas in-house offshoring of R&D has a negative effect. Specific for the manufacturing sector is that offshore outsourcing of production also has a negative significant effect. A final conclusion is that only in the service sector does in-house offshoring of services have a negative effect on the probability to anticipate an increase of domestic employment. By dissecting offshoring by tasks and channels the above empirical findings contribute to a better understanding of the aggregate effects of offshoring on domestic employment."

      "Seit Netto-Null-Ziele ein integraler Baustein der Klimapolitik sind, wird verstärkt darüber nachgedacht, zusätzlich zu einer drastischen Reduzierung der Emissionen Kohlendioxid (CO2) aktiv aus der Atmosphäre zu entfernen. Die Herausforderungen, die mit landbasierten Methoden der Kohlendioxid-Entnahme (Carbon Dioxide Removal, CDR) verbunden sind, werden zunehmend offenbar. Angesichts dessen könnte der Ozean eine neue Hoffnung sein für Strategien zur CO2-Entnahme und -Speichrung in der Europäischen Union (EU) und weltweit. Allerdings ist der Ozean ein Gebiet mit sich überschneidenden und manchmal widersprüchlichen Rechten und Pflichten. Es besteht ein Spannungsverhältnis zwischen dem souveränen Recht der Staaten, die Meeresressourcen innerhalb ihrer ausschließlichen Wirtschaftszonen zu nutzen, und der internationalen Verpflichtung, den Ozean als globales Gemeinschaftsgut zu schützen. Die EU und ihre Mitgliedstaaten müssen das Verhältnis zwischen diesen beiden Paradigmen in der Meerespolitik klären, wenn sie in Erwägung ziehen, den Ozean gezielt als Kohlenstoffsenke oder -speicher zu verwenden. Derzeit wird die Meeresstrategie-Rahmenrichtlinie überarbeitet und ein Rahmen für die Zertifizierung von CO2-Entnahmemethoden auf EU-Ebene entwickelt. Die Schaffung von Querverbindungen zwischen beiden könnte den Weg bereiten für eine Debatte über Zielkonflikte und Synergien zwischen Schutz und Nutzung von Meeresökosystemen."

      "We examine the empirical relation between CO2 emissions per capita and GDP per capita during the period 1960-1996, using a panel of 100 countries. Relying on the nonparametric poolability test of Baltagi et al. (1996), we find evidence of structural stability of the relationship. We then specify a nonparametric panel data model with country-specific effects. Estimation results show that this relationship is upward sloping. Nonparametric specification tests do not reject monotonicity but do reject the polynomial functional form which leads to the environmental Kuznets curve in several studies."

      "Pribble investigates the barter economies that developed in many of the labor camps established under the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. When the Khmer Rouge abolished currency and markets in 1975, starving Cambodians created underground exchanges in labor camps throughout the country, bartering luxury items for food and other necessities, while simultaneously undermining the regime's ideological goals of eliminating any traces of capitalism in Democratic Kampuchea. Pribble asserts three key points about the barter economy in the Khmer Rouge labor camps. First, the underground exchanges in Democratic Kampuchea provided food and medicine for desperate people subsisting under a totalitarian regime, saving the lives of countless Cambodians. Second, bartering was the riskiest way to obtain food because it was dependent upon the discretion of two or more individuals from different social classes under the threat of violent punishment, thereby altering the social dynamics of the camps. Finally, despite the regime's extreme efforts to eliminate foreign influence from the country and impose communist ideology on millions of citizens, basic forms of market capitalism and a demand for superfluous luxury goods persisted in labor camps throughout the country. A fascinating study of the human consequences of imposing rigid ideology, that will be of particular interest to scholars and students of political history and Southeast Asian history."

      "We measure the impact of search costs on farmers’ and traders’ transaction prices in Mozambique by investigating to what extent the introduction of mobile phones has affected the margin between recorded maize producer and retail market prices, and by exploring if producers or traders benefit from possible margin changes. Estimations are based on weekly producer and retail market prices of white maize grain, from July 1997 to December 2009, for 15 major producer markets in Mozambique. We find a margin increase that varies from 4.5% to 9.6%, supporting a bias of benefits of mobile phones towards maize traders and hence not less asymmetric information and increased trader competition, but rather the reverse. Impacts on producer and market prices independently vary, but confirm the margin results. Estimation results are robust for non-random rollout of the mobile phone network and various other threats."

      "The conventional discussion of the international financial crisis that erupted in the summer of 2007 is that few professional economists saw it coming, nor anticipated its ferocity in devastating the US and European economies and financial systems, leading to civil unrest and fears of greater violence in the EU. Why weren't the authorities and public warned before mid-2007? At the time, a tiny number of vocal Cassandras who delivered warnings in the media were roundly ridiculed. Now these prophets are lauded in the media. What is not widely appreciated is that there were far more professionals who gave private warnings to the large financial institutions, government regulators and central banks. These people tender their analysis in private because professional analyses of dangerous economic risks are subtle, and potentially incendiary in the hands of political populists, irresponsible media pundits and corrupt vested interests. The last thing any prudent professional would wish is to precipitate a panic. It is a tragedy that many of those who gave private warnings, were ignored, ridiculed, or in some cases, lost their jobs for challenging the financial and economic conventional wisdom. It may have been conventional, but it was far from wisdom. Because the economic crisis is continuing and imposing large costs on Western societies, it is crucial to listen again to the Cassandras. More importantly, there is not one, but three separate crises - International Private Debt, International Productivity and Income Distribution, and Western Fiscal Policy. These three crises appear to be quite separate in origin and have been brewing for decades, but the economic stresses they impose have interacted, greatly increasing their impact. The consequences of these crises for the Australian economy could be severe. Although many in the Australian establishment have boasted that Australia is relatively immune: it is a \"Lucky Country\", and has avoided the crises through wise policy, this is at best a partial truth. Professionals within and outside Australia have been warning for years that the country is not immune: downside risks have been increasing. Complacency is really dangerous."

      "The aim of this paper is to investigate the question of gender difference in the entrepreneurial orientation of managers in the post-transition economy of Slovenia. The concept of intervening variables as parts of the conative components of entrepreneurial orientation is introduced and gender differences are examined between variables. 183 Slovene top and middle managers were analysed in this respect. The results indicate that there are no gender differences in the variable to spot opportunities, to risk, to innovate, and in the intervening variable to plan, and to follow procedures, but a gender difference exists in the intervening variable to analyse, to quantify, and to justify and in the intervening variables of dexterity and craftsmanship, which could be attributed to gender occupational concentration.",
      "Der Zweck dieses Beitrags ist es, die Frage der geschlechterspezifischen Unterschiede zwischen Managern in Bezug auf ihre unternehmerische Orientierung im Kontext der Transformationsituation in Slowenien zu untersuchen. Dazu wird das Konzept der intervenierenden Variablen als Teile der konativen Komponenten unternehmerischer Orientierung eingeführt und die Geschlechterunterschiede anhand von Variablen untersucht. 183 obere und mitllere Manager wurden dazu befragt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass es keine Geschlechterunterschiede gibt bezüglich der Nutzung von Möglichkeiten, dem Risiko- und dem Innovationsverhalten und in Bezug auf die Planung und Befolgung von Verfahren. Allerdings bestehen geschlechterspezifische Unterschiede bei den intervenierenden Variablen zu analysieren, zu quantifizieren and zu beurteilen sowie bei der Geschicklichkeit und dem handwerklichen Könnens, die in einer berufsbedingten Konzentration der Geschlechter begründet liegen könnten."

      "Recently, Korea has upgraded the luminance standard of classrooms and started to introduce the air-conditioning system in order to enhance pleasantness of the learning environment. In addition, as use of auxiliary equipment, such as TV, VTR and computer, is increasing and due to school meals, energy consumption is increasing in school facilities. Despite the increase of energy consumption of school facilities, however, it is difficult to find actual data on energy consumption. Therefore, in this study, the actual conditions of energy consumption are researched, and the relation between the facility area, the number of classes and students, and the cooling and heating facilities is analyzed. And then, the basic data required for energy-saving strategies at school facilities are prepared. In conclusion, the energy consumption of the surveyed schools is increasing. The total annual energy consumption of each school is estimated to be 400-1750[MWh/yr], which varies between schools depending on the scale. The electric power consumption accounted for approx. 82% of the total energy consumption of the surveyed schools, and LNG and kerosene accounted for 14% and 4%, respectively. The schools using fans for cooling had significantly lower energy consumption than the schools with Electric Heat Pump(EHP). The annual energy consumption per unit area of the surveyed schools is approx. 67-240[kWh/m2/yr], and the annual average energy consumption per unit area is 133[kWh/m2/yr]. However, there is no significant difference in energy consumption per student. These results can be caused by various reasons, but are especially related with the size of school and the number of classes."

      "This paper explores the linkage between corporate risk management strategies, investment, and economic stability in an open economy with a flexible exchange rate regime. Firms use currency futures contracts to manage their exchange rate exposure - caused by balance sheet effects as in Krugman (2000) - and therefore their investments' sensitivity to currency risk. We find that, depending on whether futures contracts are used for risk reduction (i.e., hedging) or risk taking (i.e., speculation), the implied magnitudes of recessions and booms are decreased or increased. Corporate risk management can therefore substantially affect economic stability on the macrolevel."

      "The central vs. local nature of high-school exit exam systems can have important repercussions on the labor market. By increasing the informational content of grades, central exams may improve the sorting of students by productivity. To test this, we exploit the unique German setting where students from states with and without central exams work on the same labor market. Our difference-in-difference model estimates whether the earnings difference between individuals with high and low grades differs between central and local exams. We find that the earnings premium for a one standard-deviation increase in high-school grades is indeed 6 percent when obtained on central exams but less than 2 percent when obtained on local exams. Choices of higher-education programs and of occupations do not appear major channels of this result."

      "When a spot market monopolist has a position in a corresponding futures market, he has an incentive to deviate from the spot market optimum to make this position more profitable. Rational futures market makers take this into account when setting prices. We show that the monopolist, by randomizing his futures market position, can strategically exploit his market power at the expense of other futures market participants. Furthermore, traders without market power can manipulate futures prices by hiding their orders behind the monopolist's strategic trades. The moral hazard problem stemming from spot market power thus provides a venue for strategic trading and manipulation that parallels the adverse selection problem stemming from inside information."

      "The objective of this paper is to analyse how immigrants' ethnic identity correlates with their labour market outcomes. More precisely, we estimate the role of ethnic identity in employment, wages, under-employment (i.e., they would prefer to work more hours but are not given the opportunity), three measures of job satisfaction, overeducation and wages. We further explore whether economic downturn has a differentiated impact on our measures. Using Australian longitudinal data, we find that ethnic identity strongly is associated with employment and wages as well a number of job satisfaction measures. We then split our data and repeat the estimations for before and after the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-09. We find important differences in the way ethnic identity is associated with different measures of labour market outcomes under different economic conditions. Finally, we explore the mechanisms through which some of results could be explained."

      "This paper investigates the effect of U.S. border enforcement on the net flow of Mexican undocumented migration. It shows how this effect is theoretically ambiguous, given that increases in border controls deter prospective migrants from crossing the border illegally, but lengthen the duration of current illegal migrations. It then estimates the impact of enforcement on 1972-1993 migration net flows by merging aggregate enforcement data with micro data on potential and current illegal Mexican migrants. The econometric model accounts for the endogeneity of border controls using the Drug Enforcement Administration budget as an instrumental variable. Both the inflow and outflow of illegal Mexican migration are highly sensitive to changes in border enforcement. The estimates of the enforcement overall effect on illegal migration's net flow range across different specifications, from a decline - about 35% of the size of the effect on the inflow - to an increase. Thus, they suggest that border enforcement may not be an effective means to reduce the level of the illegal alien population in the United States."

    "abstract": [
      "Der Ministerrat der Europäischen Union will Ende März auf seinem Gipfeltreffen in Berlin die Weichen endgültig in Richtung auf eine Osterweiterung der EU stellen. In der wissenschaftlichen und politischen Diskussion besteht weitgehend Einigkeit darüber, daß diese Erweiterung des Integrationsraums um Länder, die in ihrer wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung deutlich zurückliegen, nicht nur den potentiellen Neumitgliedern, sondern vor allem auch der EU erhebliche Reformanstrengungen abverlangt. In ihrer Agenda 2000 hat die EU-Kommission ein Reformprogramm für die EU skizziert, das sie im Zuge einer Vollmitgliedschaft Sloweniens, Estlands, Ungarns, Polens und der Tschechischen Republik für unumgänglich ansieht. Das erklärte Ziel der deutschen Ratspräsidentschaft ist es daher, die Grundlinien der Agenda 2000 möglichst rasch in konkrete Reformschritte umzusetzen. Diese dynamische politische Entwicklung hat – zumindest in der öffentlichen Diskussion – den Blick auf die Frage verstellt, ob die in der Agenda 2000 skizzierten Reformschritte in der Tat ausreichen, um eine erfolgreiche Integration der relativ jungen Marktwirtschaften im Osten Europas zu gewährleisten. Seit der Veröffentlichung der Agenda 2000 mehren sich die wissenschaftlichen Stimmen, die dieses Reformprogramm – zumindest in Teilen – für unzureichend halten.1 Das Ziel dieses Beitrags ist es daher zu analysieren, ob die Agenda 2000 das Finale oder lediglich die Ouvertüre zu Reformen im Zuge der EU-Osterweiterung darstellt. Zunächst werden die Reformzwänge in der Gemeinsamen Agrarpolitik und der Struktur- und Kohäsionspolitik der EU identifiziert und Reformvorschläge für diese Bereiche präsentiert (Abschnitt II). Anschließend wird der Reformbedarf innerhalb der EU-Institutionen skizziert. Der Schwerpunkt liegt hier auf einer Diskussion über die Effizienz der Entscheidungsmechanismen (Abschnitt III). Abschließend wird erörtert, inwieweit die Agenda 2000 dem identifizierten Reformbedarf gerecht wird (Abschnitt IV)."

      "This paper introduces a generalized representation of the formation of continuous preferences (which can reflect different intensities). The preference intensity that a child adopts is formed as the collective outcome of all role models for preference intensities - which are derived from the socioeconomic actions of adults - that it socially learns from. We then show how the adopted preference intensities induce preferences over socioeconomic choices. Finally, this cultural formation of preferences process is endogenized as resulting out of optimal parental socialization decisions. This framework thus endogenously determines the intergenerational evolution of preference intensities and the induced preferences."

      "The urgency to tackle climate change has placed sustainable development at the centre of recent trade related narratives. With trade being considered as means to achieve sustainable development goals, one issue to be addressed is how to adjust trade negotiations which used to be the main approach to pursuing market opening. In this context, this paper examines trade negotiations on environmental services by focusing on developing economies' participation. Environmental services and related trade play a critical role in achieving environmental and sustainable development goals. Nevertheless, developing economies' participation in environmental services trade negotiations has been limited. By analysing the reasons behind such limited participation and assessing some new approaches, this paper attempts to explore how environmental services trade negotiations could be adapted to better engage developing economies and serve sustainable development goals."

      "We assess market integration and price transmission of perishable agricultural produce in Sub-Saharan Africa by studying Ghanaian tomato markets which are characterized by pronounced seasonality in production and trade flows. We analyse the tomato markets of Ghana by simultaneously regarding its five most important markets, Navrongo, Techiman, Kumasi, Tamale and Accra, in a multivariate asymmetric price transmission framework. The estimation of the model is based on a unique dataset and on a modified version of the Johansen estimation procedure which is suitable for estimating such multivariate models. We estimate the price transmission parameters for four regimes which are a combination of the seasonal patterns in trade flows and asymmetries in the long-run price equilibrium between the most important production region (Techiman) and the most important consumption centre for tomatoes (Accra). We find strong evidence for integration of the five markets. In general, price transmission appears to be fast. Disequilibria mainly trigger price responses in the two production regions of Navrongo and Techiman. The regimes are found to matter for the whole system of tomato markets. Disequilibrium is shown to spillover between the price relationships. Consequently, tomato markets in Ghana appear to be integrated and function very well since price signals are rapidly passed through the country."

      "This paper examines the distributional impacts of the changes to benefits, tax credits, pensions and direct taxes between the UK Elections in May 2010 and in May 2015. It also looks ahead to the longer-term effects of changes and plans that were announced by the 2010-2015 Coalition government, such as the complete introduction of Universal Credit and changes to the ways benefits, pensions and tax brackets are indexed from year to year, modelling what effects these would have after five more years. It shows that the changes 2010-15 did not have a common effect on all household incomes and nor did the direct tax-benefit changes contribute to deficit reduction. In effect reductions in benefits and tax credits financed part of the cuts in direct taxes. We find that the relative extent to which the changes most favoured the rich or the poor is sensitive to a wide range of analytical choices and assumptions, but under most sets of assumptions the main gains were in the upper middle of the income distribution and the main losers were at the bottom and those close to, but not at, the very top. Across most of the distribution the impact of the changes was regressive. Looking forward to the effects that Coalition policies would have had by 2020 we find a more strongly regressive picture but with open questions about the effect of Universal Credit on those not currently receiving their entitlements to means-tested payments, and so potentially increasing some of the lowest incomes."

      "In this working paper, we analyze factors that may explain gender differences in the allocation of time to household production in sub-Saharan Africa. The study uses time use survey data to analyze the determinants of time spent on household production by husbands and wives in nuclear families in Ethiopia, Ghana, Tanzania, and South Africa. We assume that the time spent by each spouse is a function of personal and household characteristics. A bivariate Tobit model is used to estimate the marginal impact of a set of key variables that figure recurrently in the literature on time allocation. We observe a high degree of variability in the results for the set of countries, which does not allow us to draw hard general conclusions. We do find some weak evidence that supports time availability and gender ideology theory as well as for the hypothesis that bargaining power plays a role in explaining the intrahousehold allocation of household production."

      "This paper explores the impact of New Zealand's exchange rate variability on the tradable sector, and policy options for dampening exchange rate variability. It finds that exchange rate variability in the medium term is likely to have a negative impact on the tradable sector. However, the link between exchange rate variability and the performance of the tradable sector is not automatic; many factors are at work. New Zealand's tradable and non-tradable sector trends are mirrored in some other countries with varying degrees of exchange rate variability. This suggests that exchange rate variability may explain part of the story as to why New Zealand's tradable sector has underperformed, but it cannot tell the whole story. This paper recognises the significant negative impact that a sustained high level of the exchange rate can have on the tradable sector. There are no easy or obvious ways to reduce exchange rate variability without some costs. This paper first explores alternative exchange rate regimes, and finds that the freely- floating exchange rate regime is still the most appropriate for New Zealand. Second, this paper explores ways to reduce exchange rate variability within the existing framework. While there are no silver bullets available to reduce exchange rate variability within the existing framework, fiscal policy and housing policy are worth pursuing in this respect, with the possibility for macro-prudential policy to play a small role in stabilising the cycle."

      "Flucht und Migration aus den Ländern der Dritten Welt haben in den letzten Jahrzehnten ein vorher nie gekanntes Ausmaß angenommen und sie werden zukünftig voraussichtlich noch alles bisher Dagewesene übertreffen. Afrika ist von diesen Wanderungsbewegungen besonders stark betroffen. Obwohl Anfang der 1990er Jahre der Zustrom von Afrikanern auch nach Europa beträchtlich angewachsen ist, sind es doch afrikanische – und nicht europäische - Staaten, die die Hauptlast dieser Flüchtlingsbewegungen zu tragen haben. Sowohl die Ursachen als auch die Auswirkungen der Flucht und Migration sind je nach Gruppen- und Schichtzugehörigkeit unterschiedlich. Die ohnehin schon Armen und Entrechteten, Alten, Frauen und Kinder haben unter sonst gleichen Umständen am meisten zu leiden. Afrikanische Flüchtlinge sind in Europa aus einer Vielzahl von Gründen gegenüber ihren Leidensgenossen aus anderen Regionen der Dritten Welt besonders benachteiligt. In dem Maße wie Flucht und Migration soziale und wirtschaftliche Probleme bei uns und in Übersee verursachen, nimmt auch das Interesse der Politiker zu, diese Probleme zu instrumentalisieren und für eigene Zwecke auszunutzen. Die Taktik einiger afrikanischer Staatsmänner, den Wanderungsdruck afrikanischer Flüchtlinge und Migranten auf Europa als Faustpfand für die Einforderung von mehr Entwicklungshilfe zu nutzen, und die Allianz der deutschen Innen- und Entwicklungspolitik in Fragen der vorbeugenden \"Fluchtursachen-Vermeidung\" durch Entwicklungshilfe sind nur zwei Seiten ein und derselben Medaille; beide Argumente halten einer empirischen Überprüfung nicht stand. Die Entwicklungshilfe erhöht mittelfristig nach allen bisherigen Erfahrungen eher die Bereitschaft der Jungen und Agilen zur Auswanderung. Die gegenwärtigen innenpolitischen Probleme Deutschlands mit dem Zustrom von Asylbewerbern lassen sich so nicht lösen. Das Asylrecht, das primär dem Schutz politisch Verfolgter dienen soll, wird durch die Massenwanderung von Elendsflüchtlingen aus der Dritten Welt offensichtlich völlig überfordert. Es müßte daher durch ein sowohl sozial als auch wirtschaftlich ausgewogenes Einwanderungsrecht ergänzt werden.",
      "\"Hard times for African refugees\": Flight and migration from the Third World countries have assumed a previously unprecedented scale in the last decades. They are expected to exceed all that has been happening before. Africa is particularly affected by these migratory movements. Although, in the early 1990s, the influx of Africans to Europe has grown considerably, African, not European countries have to bear the main burden of these refugee movements. Both, the causes as well as the effects of the flight and migration are different, depending on the social group and strata to which they belong. The already poor and deprived, the elderly, women and children, suffer the most. African refugees are particularly disadvantaged in Europe for a variety of reasons against their fellow-sufferers from other regions of the Third World. To the extent that flight and migration cause social and economic problems at home and overseas, the interest of politicians is also increasing to exploit these problems for their own purposes. The tactics of some African statesmen to use the migratory pressure of African refugees and migrants on Europe as bargaining chip for more development aid, and the alliance of German domestic and development policy in matters of preventive \"avoidance of causes of flight\" through development assistance are only two sides and the same medal. Both arguments do not stand up to an empirical review. In the medium term, development aid shall increase the willingness of the young and most agile to emigrate. The current domestic political problems of Germany concerning the influx of refugees can not be solved in this way. The right of asylum, which is intended primarily to protect politically persecuted persons, is obviously sidelined by the mass migration of economic refugees from the Third World. It should therefore be supplemented by a socially as well as economically balanced immigration legislation.",
      "RÉSUMÉ \"Temps difficiles pour les réfugiés africains\": La fuit et la migration en provenance des pays du tiers monde ont pris une ampleur sans précédent au cours des dernières décennies. On s'attend à ce qu'ils dépassent tout ce qui s'est passé auparavant. L'Afrique est particulièrement touchée par ces mouvements migratoires. Bien qu'au début des années 1990, l'afflux d'Africains vers l'Europe ait considérablement augmenté, les pays africains, et pas les pays européens, doivent supporter la charge principale de ces mouvements de réfugiés. Les deux, les causes ainsi que les effets de la fuit et de la migration sont différents, selon le groupe social et les strates auxquelles les refugiées appartiennent. Les personnes déjà pauvres et démunies, les personnes âgées, les femmes et les enfants souffrent le plus. Les réfugiées africains sont particulièrement défavorisés en Europe pour diverses raisons vis `vis leurs compagnons d'infortune d'autres régions du tiers monde. Dans la mesure où la fuit et la migration causent des problèmes sociaux et économiques au pays natal et à l'étranger, l'intérêt des politiciens augmente également pour exploiter ces problèmes à leurs propres fins. La tactique de certains hommes d'Etat africains d'utiliser la pression migratoire des réfugiés et migrants africains sur l'Europe comme monnaie d'échange pour plus d'aide au développement, et l'alliance de la politique intérieure et de développement allemande en proposant l’aide au développement comme meilleurs solution en matière de prévention des causes de fuite, seront seulement deux côtés et la même médaille. Les deux arguments ne résistent pas à une revue empirique. À moyen terme, l'aide au développement doit accroître la volonté des jeunes et des plus agiles d'émigrer. Les problèmes politiques intérieurs actuels de l'Allemagne concernant l'afflux de réfugiés ne peuvent être résolus de cette manière. Le droit d'asile, qui vise principalement à protéger les personnes politiquement persécutées, est évidemment mis de côté par la migration massive de réfugiés économiques du tiers monde. Il devrait donc être complété par une législation d'immigration socialement et économiquement équilibrée."

      "In 2016, only 4% of energy consumption in transportation came from renewables; then, use of fossil fuels will continue by several decades, with their corresponding evaporative and combustion emissions. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from gasoline evaporation were determined in Mexico City in order to know the emission of each compound to the atmosphere, as well as their ozone formation potential. Headspace technique was used to characterize the VOC evaporated mixture from different gasolines consumed in the city. Analyses of VOCs were carried out by chromatography with flame ionization detector. Composition of gasoline vapors was 18.40 ± 4.43 for paraffin, 52.4 ± 2.09 for iso-paraffin, 11.8 ± 3.71 for olefins, 3.1 ± 1.09 for naphthenes, and 12.1 ± 3.23 for aromatics (% w/w), which is quite different of exhaust emissions from gasoline vehicles. The content of carcinogenic VOCs was 0.44 ± 0.07 and 0.02 ± 0.01 (% w/w) for benzene and 1,3-butadiene, respectively, but despite the small content, they should be reduced as much as possible to protect inhabitants health. Despite i-sopentane, methylpentanes, n-pentane, and the sum of trimethylpentanes, had the greater abundance in evaporative emissions, the major contributors to reactivity were the olefins contributing with 62% for the potential ozone formation, estimated with the maximum incremental reactivity."

      "Tax changes are often announced before their implementation and are not permanent, but rather only temporary. Accordingly, R&D firms will optimally adjust their investment decisions to fit tax schedule changes. This study analyzes how changes in various tax rates relevant to corporate activities affect growth and welfare, considering their methods of implementation. For this purpose, we consider adjustment costs involved in the investment process and allow firms to make a forward looking investment decision in a R&D-based endogenous growth model. Calibrating the model with U.S. data, we find that a dividend tax cut reduces the level of welfare irrespective of implementation method. On the other hand, a capital gains tax cut and a rise in the R&D tax credit rate enhance the level of welfare irrespective of implementation. However, the announcement of these tax changes prior to implementation reduces their effectiveness."

      "Small start-up firms are the engine of job creation in early transition and yet little is known about the characteristics of this new sector. We seek to identify patterns of job growth in this sector in terms of niches left from central planning and ask about differences in job creation across two different transition economies: Estonia, which experienced rapid destruction of the pre-existing firms, and the Czech Republic, which reduced the old sector gradually. We find job growth within industries to be quantitatively more important than job growth due to across-industry reallocation. Furthermore, the industrial composition of startups is strikingly similar in the two countries. We offer convergence to \"western\" industry firm-size distributions as an explanation. We also find regularities in wage evolution across new and old firms, including small differences in job quality across the two transition paths."

      "Supplier selection and allocation of optimal order quantity are two of the most important processes in closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) and reverse logistic (RL). So that providing high quality raw material is considered as a basic requirement for a manufacturer to produce popular products, as well as achieve more market shares. On the other hand, considering the existence of competitive environment, suppliers have to offer customers incentives like discounts and enhance the quality of their products in a competition with other manufacturers. Therefore, in this study, a model is presented for CLSC optimization, efficient supplier selection, as well as orders allocation considering quantity discount policy. It is modeled using multi-objective programming based on the integrated simultaneous data envelopment analysis-Nash bargaining game. In this study, maximizing profit and efficiency and minimizing defective and functions of delivery delay rate are taken into accounts. Beside supplier selection, the suggested model selects refurbishing sites, as well as determining the number of products and parts in each network's sector. The suggested model's solution is carried out using global criteria method. Furthermore, based on related studies, a numerical example is examined to validate it."

      "Reduced free time and increased fees for demurrage and detention create organizational challenges with respect to intermodal transport. As a result, actors within the maritime supply chains are confronted with greater complexity and higher risk of costs; and, therefore, often fall back on transportation by truck to and from the hinterland. That is why the present research examines the impact of this evolution on the bottom line of the involved actors from a maritime supply chain perspective. The research approach consists of reviewing the relevant literature, analyzing the available sector data obtained through interviews and professional experience, and validating the proposed solutions. Starting from the research results, the problem-solving discussions resulted in the following top three as feasible solutions: digitalization, extra 'free time' for hinterland locations, and more attention during the negotiation process."

      "We use Statistics Canada's Labour Force Survey to explore the labor market impacts of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Specifically, we adopt a unique identification strategy to examine the heterogeneous causal effects of the COVID-19 economic shutdown by governments on hours worked across the earnings distribution in Canada, focusing on individuals who remained employed in March and April. Most early crisis analyses found that workers in the bottom of the earnings distribution experienced a much larger negative shock to hours worked than workers in the top of the earnings distribution. However, some low-income individuals are also working more as a result of the COVID-19 economic shutdown, and this nuance is missed when only considering the net effect. When we condition on whether workers lost or gained hours, we find that workers in the bottom of the earnings distribution experienced not only the largest percentage reduction in hours, but also the largest percentage increase in hours."

      "This paper considers the effect of different firm leadership on the innovative performance of firms from seven EU countries. We investigate whether owner-led or manager-led firms achieve a larger share of their turnover with product innovations. Economic theory does not propose clear answers to this question. In the empirical analysis, it turns out that the manager-led firms are more active innovators : the share of sales based on new products is larger if firms' managers do not hold any of the firms' capital. Surprisingly, there are no differences between the seven countries included in the regression analysis."

      "Income inequality is a major problem in Thailand. A key determinant of income inequality in Thailand is the lack of financial access to financial institutions for low-income families. Microfinance institutions (MFIs) play an important role in enabling poor households to access financial resources at a reasonable cost. The purpose of this paper is to investigate factors that affect Thai households participating in microfinance programs in Thailand. A multinomial logit model is used to investigate the factors that impact the Thai households' access to microfinance. The study employs secondary data from the Thai Socioeconomic Survey (cross-sectional data in 2017) to identify factors affecting Thai household participation in microfinance programs. The results show that the Village Fund (VF) targets low-income rural households and encourages those with older household heads who have lower levels of education, and female household heads, to participate in their program. Larger households are more likely to access the VF. Households with higher dependency ratios are less likely to borrow from the VF. Households with well-educated, young household heads in regional areas are more likely to borrow money from Saving Groups for Production (SGPs). SGP borrower households have higher household incomes than VF borrower households. Our findings indicate that VFs and SGPs are credit sources in the rural credit market; these sources enable rural households to access credit to meet their needs. In addition, rural Thai households borrow from many sources so that they can rotate their loan repayments. Low-income households refinance their loans by borrowing from different sources."

      "Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been studied extensively in developed countries. However, although most of the world's consumers live in developing countries, the study of CSR in developing countries in general, and in Bolivia in particular, still is very limited. Developing countries are characterized by widespread poverty, corruption, inequality, social exploitation, and environmental pollution and, consequently, offer abundant opportunities for CSR. In addition, research on CSR in developing countries has the potential to promote equality, social justice, transparency, and accountability by holding frequently irresponsible local and international organizations to account. For that purpose, this study explores the nature of CSR practices and their effectiveness in influencing consumer attitudes in Bolivia as the least developed among the developing countries in the Americas. To this end, this study uses data collected in Bolivia through both structured surveys (quantitative data) and unstructured questionnaires/in-depth interviews (qualitative data). Using structural equation modeling of the quantitative data on two product categories and multiple brand contexts from 1016 consumers, this study tests a series of hypotheses on the consequences of CSR practices in developing countries. The results indicate that CSR practices exert both a direct influence on customer satisfaction and an indirect, mediated influence on customer loyalty. Moreover, the results of qualitative data analysis suggest that multinational companies and young managers are leading the way in implementing CSR practices in Bolivia. Managerial implications are discussed."

      "Gender inequalities in longevity/mortality are a major area of research since the 1970s. Despite substantial insights, the questions posed and the research strategies used are still in a state of flux. In the present paper we shed some light on the question, to which extent socioeconomic variables determine the gender gap in mortality for important causes of death. Thereby we specifically focus on behavior-related causes of death. We follow an ecological approach based on aggregated mortality data from Austria both at the community and the district level covering the time period 1969 - 2004. By using weighted regression analysis (panel fixed effects, pooled and cross section) we find that higher income levels reduce male mortality in most causes of death (including malignant neoplasms and diseases of the circulatory system), while this indicator appear to be insignificant for female mortality in these causes. This indicates that the decreasing effect of the higher socioeconomic status on mortality might be canceled out by a \"gender role equalization\" effect for women due to the adoption of unhealthy life styles (e.g. smoking). This finding is also confirmed by the fact that female mortality does not decrease with increasing income levels for smoking-related diseases, ischaemic heart disease and lung cancer. Thus, our results suggest that the decreasing female mortality advantage is mainly caused by increased smoking among women, while in the case of alcohol, violence and accidents the gender equalization seems to work in the opposite direction. In a nutshell, we conclude that the examination of the gender-specific mortality rates and mortality gaps without a disaggregation between different causes of death might mask important patterns of the epidemiological transition and the underlying drivers."

      "FinTech is a disruptive international phenomenon that is expected to shape the future of the financial sector. This study describes the features and characteristics of the current Saudi Arabian FinTech landscape and ecosystem. Examples of innovative financial startups in Saudi Arabia, including online banking, transfer and payment services, crowdfunding platforms, peer-to-peer lending, and blockchain initiatives, are discussed. Several changes have occurred within the ecosystem in the last five years; for example, Saudi banks are taking a more cautious approach. However, FinTech initiatives are also being internally developed, encouraging technology companies and startups to focus their efforts on innovations aimed at improving current processes rather than novelty. The government directs its effort mainly toward initiatives related to regulations and laws. Customers are interested in new products that are convenient and easy to use. We compare the Saudi FinTech ecosystem to the United Arab Emirates' FinTech ecosystem and conclude with recommendations for the different stakeholders."

      "Seit den 80er Jahren haben atypische Erwerbsformen gegenüber dem traditionellen Normalarbeitsverhältnis in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland an Bedeutung gewonnen. In der arbeitsmarktpolitischen Debatte gilt das Interesse an Erwerbsformen wie Leiharbeit, geringfügige und befristete Beschäftigung deren Beitrag zur Arbeitsmarktintegration. Diese Studie beschäftigt sich mit der Frage, ob atypische Erwerbsformen den Übergang in reguläre Beschäftigung eher erleichtern oder erschweren. Der Schwerpunkt liegt dabei auf dem Risikopotential atypischer Erwerbsformen mit Blick auf den zukünftigen Erwerbsverlauf.",
      "Since the 80´s atypical employment forms in Germany have gained significance in relation to the traditional 'regular employment relationship'. In the labour market policy debate the interest in employment forms such as agency work, marginal parttime work and temporary work relates to their contribution to labour market integration. This study concerns itself with the question whether atypical employment forms facilitate or hamper the transition to regular employment. The emphasis is thereby on the risk potential of atypical employment forms with view to the future employment course."

      "This paper studies the long-term consequences of communism on present-day freedom of expression values in two settings - East Germany and the states linked to the sphere of influence of the former USSR. Exploiting the natural experiment of German separation and later reunification, we show that living under communism has had lasting effects on free speech opinions. While free speech salience has increased for East and West Germans vis-à-vis other government goals, the convergence process has been slow. East Germans are still less likely to consider freedom of speech a key government priority compared to West Germans. Additionally, our analyses of secret police surveillance data from East Germany point to the fact that geographybased measures of community experiences of past political repression do not explain our findings. The same conclusion holds when we look at the setting of the former Soviet Union and we correlate proximity to Stalin's former labor camps in the Soviet Union with present-day freedom of speech values. At the same time, family experiences with political repression in Eastern Europe/the former Soviet Union exert a discernible influence on current values towards freedom of speech, likely due to a lasting impact stemming from such personal encounters. As such, our paper adds a nuanced contribution to the economics of free speech, suggesting that freedom of speech may be a part of informal institutions and slow-changing cultural values."

      "This paper makes use of data from the German socio-economic panel to gain new insights into the determinants of unemployment duration in Germany. Due to substantial differences with respect to labour market outcomes we follow a stratified approach with respect to gender and ethnicity. To analyze unemployment duration comprehensively, dynamic duration time models are used in which covariate effects are allowed to vary smoothly with unemployment duration and others enter the model in an a-priori unspecified functional form. We control for unobserved heterogeneity by following a modern frailty approach. As fitting routine we use penalized spline smoothing effects using available software in R. We demonstrate with state-of-the-art regression models how effects of covariables change, either over duration time or within their range and reveal substantial differences across gender end ethnicities for the German labour market. Among others we find large effects of family characteristics for women and a minor importance of formal qualifications for immigrants."

By using the local Whittle estimator, the statistic takes the supremum among combinations of paired aggregated series. Simulations show that the test performs good in finite sample sizes, and is able to distinguish long memory from spurious processes with excellent power. Moreover, the empirical application gives further evidence that the observed long memory in German stock returns is spurious."

      "We examine a new class of games, which we call social games, where players not only choose strategies but also choose with whom they play. A group of players who are dissatisfied with the play of their current partners can join together and play a new equilibrium. This imposes new refinements on equilibrium play, where play depends on the relative populations of players in different roles, among other things. We also examine finite repetitions of games where players may choose to rematch in any period. Some equilibria of fixed-player repeated games cannot be sustained as equilibria in a repeated social game. Conversely, the set of repeated matching (or social) equilibria also includes some plays that are not part of any subgame perfect equilibrium of the corresponding fixed-player repeated games. We explore existence under different equilibrium definitions, as well as the relationship to renegotiation-proof equilibrium. It is possible for repeated matching equilibria to be completely distinct from renegotiation-proof equilibria, and even to be Pareto inefficient."

      "Establishment surveys around the globe have measured the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on establishments' conditions and business practices. At the same time, the consequences of the pandemic, such as closures, hygiene standards, or remote work arrangements, may have also altered patterns of survey participation and introduced nonresponse bias, threatening the quality of establishment survey data. To investigate these issues, this article examines fieldwork outcomes, nonresponse bias, and predictors of survey participation in the IAB-Job Vacancy Survey. As comparisons with previous survey years show, it became more difficult to successfully interview establishments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using linked administrative data, we show that nonresponse bias was higher in 2020 compared to previous years, even after applying the standard weighting adjustment. However, general patterns of survey participation in 2020 were similar to previous years and COVID-19 related measures were not strong predictors of survey participation in 2020. Further, we provide evidence that nonresponse bias during the pandemic can be reduced by incorporating additional administrative variables into the weighting procedure relative to the standard weighting variables. We conclude this article with a discussion of the findings and implications for survey practitioners."

      "Using data from the 2013 China Household Income Project (CHIP), this study investigates the effects of minimum wages on labour market returns for rural migrants in China and sheds light on the potential underlying mechanisms of these effects. An instrumental variable estimation is used to address the endogeneity problem of minimum wages on labour market returns. Our empirical findings indicate that minimum wages have positive effects on migrants’ wages. Specifically, we observe higher effects for women and migrants who have higher education levels. Regarding the possible mechanisms through which minimum wages influence migrants’ labour market returns, we find that minimum wages tend to increase rural migrants’ working time but have no significant effects on allowances related to work. We could not obtain conclusive results for social insurance due to its potential endogeneity."

      "Purpose: Was examined the relationship between social culture, Industry 4.0 technologies, and organizational performance in companies from emerging countries. Design/methodology/approach: Were chose medium and large companies from emerging Latin American economies. Colombia and Peru as the most advanced economies, and Ecuador for being in the first phase of growth. It was Data from 428 workers collected through online surveys. The data analysis was carried out using a Structural Equation Model. Findings: The results indicated a relationship between Industry 4.0 technologies and organizational performance and social culture and organizational performance. Furthermore, social culture does not mediate the relationship between Industry 4.0 technologies and organizational performance. Differences were also found among countries. Evidence is provided that Industry 4.0 technologies and social culture lead to better organizational performance. Practical implications: This study showed that, in the context of analysis, the level of maturity regarding the use of 4.0 technologies of medium and large companies is still incipient. Provides (1) information on cultural differences, mainly in the dimensions of Masculinity, Power Distance, and Individualism; and (2) guidelines on the use of Industry 4.0 technologies and their implication in Organizational Performance. Originality/value: The research results provide knowledge of the relationship between 4.0 technologies, social culture, and organizational performance in the context of emerging economies where the subject has been little investigated."

      "Women start fewer businesses than men. The start-up rate among women in Germany falls short of males' start-up rate by one third. We scrutinize this gender gap using individual-level data from the KfW Start-up Monitor, a large-scale population survey on start-up activity in Germany. As a unique feature, the data combine socio-demographic characteristics, entrepreneurship-related attitudes, and general personality traits of both business starters and non-starters. Estimating binary choice models and employing decomposition techniques, we find that gender differences in socio-demographics alone would even be in favor of higher start-up rates among women, while the distribution of personality traits is less favorable for business start-ups among women and explains about one third of the entire gender difference. Most substantially, men opt for a start-up more often even given identical human capital and related endowments. Qualificational policies targeted towards higher educational attainments of potential entrepreneurs do thus not suffice to increase the number of female business starters."

      "Capital market remains an effective channel of financial intermediation. However, it has been underperforming in developing economies and thus resulting in the attendant illiquidity and other inefficiencies. This study examined the response of All-Share Index (ASI) to external financial flows shock since accessing capital from the capital market to augment the saving-investment gap has necessitated the high demand for external financial flows in Nigeria. The study employed data from 1981 to 2021 and the framework of impulse-response function and short-run pairwise Granger-causality approach were used. The finding showed that the impulse-responses of ASI for one-unit shocks to remittance from personal transfers, remittance from compensation of employees (RECE), trade openness and official development assistance (ODA) had noticeable positive impacts on ASI from the short to long-run. While shocks to FDI and FPI had negative impacts on ASI in the long-run. Also, the causal relationships were mixed-revealing across the time periods. The implication is that policymakers must develop policy directions to suit the time horizon of capital flows because the policy measures aimed at directing long-run capital inflows should not be the same as those aimed at changing the short-run patterns of flow in enhancing capital market performance."

      "In several African regions, economic integration has successfully reduced tariff protection by freezing the opportunity to raise applied tariffs against fellow integration partners above those promised. In this paper, we examine whether the regional tariff commitments on the continent have come at the expense of adverse side-effects on the prevalence of other - nontariff - trade barriers. More specifically, regional tariff commitments have not only amplified applied tariff overhangs - the difference between Most Favoured Nation (MFN) bound tariffs and effectively applied tariffs - for African members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), but have also sharply reduced their tariff policy space within Africa, thus leaving regulatory policies such as sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures and technical barriers to trade (TBT) as two of the few legitimate options to level the playing field with market competitors. Comparing the effects of applied tariff overhangs towards all vis-à-vis African trading partners on SPS and TBT notifications of 35 African WTO members between 2001 and 2017, we find no overall relationship between tariff overhangs and import regulation in our preferred model setting. By contrast, larger tariff overhangs specific to intra-African trade relations have a significant share in increasing the probability of SPS measures and TBT. Our findings have important implications for future Pan-African integration under the recently launched African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in that success in fostering continental economic integration does not exclusively depend on the realisation of tariff liberalisation, but at the same time on a mindful coordination with non-tariff provisions."

      "At independence in 1975, the Frelimo government took over public administration from the colonial system and started to transform it. The public financial management (PFM) system was adapted to the central planning and management of the economy in line with nationalist and Marxist-Leninist thinking. Collapse followed in the mid-1980s, amidst the Cold War and the liberalization of the economy. The PFM system was gradually and systematically reformed towards more transparent and efficient mechanisms, and successful reforms did coincide with high rates of economic growth for more than 20 years, after 1993. The reform process was supported by sizeable foreign aid to the extent that Mozambique became highly aid dependent. As the nationalist agenda became more forceful from around 2005-10, when the existence of large natural gas reserves in the Rovuma Basin was confirmed, the extraction of natural resources became the main government focus as a source of public revenue, and severe cracks in the PFM system started to emerge. The 'hidden debt' scandal in 2013-14, the renewed conflict between Frelimo and Renamo from 2013, and the insurgency war in Cabo Delgado from 2017 put the PFM system under pressure and performance suffered accordingly with significant economic and social costs. The paper brings out how difficult it is to make institutional reforms work, within a structure of political and economic power that may not benefit from them, even in the context of a high degree of aid dependence."

      "This paper has three objectives. First, a review of the developing body of work on the economics of immigration in Ireland is provided. Second, the analysis undertaken by Barrett and McCarthy (forthcoming) of earnings of immigrants in Ireland is updated. Third, the earnings of immigrant women are assessed to see if they experience a 'double disadvantage'. Among other findings, the review of the emerging literature points to immigrants faring less well in the Irish labour market relative to native employees. As regards the analysis conducted in this paper, we find that immigrants were earning 15 percent less than comparable natives employees in 2005. For immigrants from non-English speaking countries, the wage disadvantage was 20 percent. The corresponding figure for immigrants from the EU's New Member States was 31 percent. A double disadvantage is found for immigrant women, with the earnings of female immigrants found to be 14 percent less than those of comparable native female employees. This double disadvantage is concentrated among female immigrants with third level degrees."

      "The determinants of venture capital investment have attracted a significant amount of attention from both academics and policymakers. We use a version of the Keuschnigg-Nielsen model for venture-capital financed projects to condition our analysis on a reasonable set of exogenous variables but we focus on one determinant: financial market structure. The type of financial market structure (bank- or market-based) contributes substantially to explaining differences among countries with respect to the extent of venture capital investments in the initial business stages. We will use the cross country and time series variation from a panel of 19 industrialised countries to support the hypothesis that venture capital thrives within market-based financial systems and is confined to an ancillary role in bank-based systems."

      "Regional research has focused on the innovation-competitiveness-growth chain, which is implicit in Territorial Innovation Systems. This literature has neglected or subordinated social and ecological regional conditions. We see this study as a first step towards more systematic research on what might be termed ?Territorial Sustainability Systems.? We study local sustainability planning processes under the label of Local Agenda 21 (LA21) in Italy. A model is proposed in which the integration of resources explains the engagement of municipal authorities with LA21-type processes that are implemented within a networking structure. Two types of resources, municipal (or internal resources), and relational resources, are considered. Relational resources stem from: (1) dyadic relations with higher levels of government (HLG), and (2) network relations (municipality-HLG-municipality). The model is tested by considering the perceptions of local authorities who are in charge of LA21 processes in Italy. The results show moderate/low engagement with LA21 processes, which is explained by moderate/poor levels of relational resources. Our findings indicate that local authority engagement with LA21-type processes requires a systemic perspective, where HLG and municipalities integrate and combine their resources and create new purposefully-led resources through regular and intense interactions."

      "This paper illustrates different scenarios of implementing an emissions trading scheme and investigates the economic implications of diverse baseline development paths and an additional limitation or ceiling on emissions trading. The analysis focuses on the impacts of dissimilar emissions reductions options, i.e. to decrease emissions by domestic action or by Annex B emissions trading. World economic impacts are investigated by a world general equilibrium model including 11 international regions and 4 production sectors. Various strategies including flexible instruments, like a ceiling on regional emissions trading and the interregional and intertemporal trade of emissions permits are simulated, compared and evaluated. It turns out that meeting the Kyoto target induces welfare losses to developed and developing countries, an emissions trading option can reduce global and regional welfare losses significantly. Essentially, these welfare losses depend considerably on assumed emissions baseline paths. A ceiling on emissions trading scheme diminishes positive economic effects on global and regional welfare, especially within economies in transition."

      "This paper explores how firms that lack expertise in machine learning (ML) can leverage the so-called AI Flywheel effect. This effect designates a virtuous cycle by which, as an ML product is adopted and new user data are fed back to the algorithm, the product improves, enabling further adoptions. However, managing this feedback loop is difficult, especially when the algorithm is contracted out. Indeed, the additional data that the AI Flywheel effect generates may change the provider's incentives to improve the algorithm over time. We formalize this problem in a simple two-period moral hazard framework that captures the main dynamics among ML, data acquisition, pricing, and contracting. We find that the firm's decisions crucially depend on how the amount of data on which the machine is trained interacts with the provider's effort. If this effort has a more (less) significant impact on accuracy for larger volumes of data, the firm underprices (overprices) the product. Interestingly, these distortions sometimes improve social welfare, which accounts for the customer surplus and profits of both the firm and provider. Further, the interaction between incentive issues and the positive externalities of the AI Flywheel effect has important implications for the firm's data collection strategy. In particular, the firm can boost its profit by increasing the product's capacity to acquire usage data only up to a certain level. If the product collects too much data per user, the firm's profit may actually decrease, i.e., more data is not necessarily better. As a result, the firm should consider reducing its product's data acquisition capacity when its initial dataset to train the algorithm is large enough."

Our findings confirm that giving local governments strong incentives to compete with each other exacerbates the market distortions inherent in a partially reformed economy."

      "Flexibility in response to competitive pressure from globalized markets and increasingly individualized customer desires has become vital for firms. A common strategy to address this challenge is to employ a dynamic concept of organization and reach beyond the boundaries of the firm. Accordingly, technology transfer from providers of knowledge intensive business services attracts more and more attention. In this context we focus on external supply of information technology and client-side innovation. The aim of this paper is to contribute to resolving an empirical puzzle arising from the prior literature. Some authors find beneficial effects of IT outsourcing, others underline that firms often fail to achieve expected strategic goals. Our stylized theoretical model combines a knowledge production function framework and transaction cost economics. We hypothesize that the right balance between internal and external knowledge is critical for innovation. The empirical application is German firm-level data covering a wide range of industries from 2003 to 2006. Our results largely support the theoretical arguments and suggest a positive linear relationship between the level of outsourcing and process innovation. For product innovation we find a hump-shape."

      "With the amount of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) being generated every year and increasing at an accelerating rate, the management of electronic waste (e-waste) has become an important global issue. This article contains a literature survey and a practical study of five mobile phones. In the literature survey WEEE management approaches in the EU and China were evaluated to identify differences and commonalities in approach as well as the identification of the current best practices. Practical End-of-Life (EoL) treatment processes, including remanufacturing, reconditioning, repairing, recycling, repurposing, reusing and disposal of e-waste were all investigated and studied in context of mobile phones. In the phone disassembly exercise the component material, weight, joining method, possibility of re-attachment and damage of disassembly were identified and noted down for every removed component. This disassembly gave insight in how the WEEE management in the EU could be adapted to improve the amount of component recovery. A final suggestion is to implement an EU objective open-access component database where original equipment manufacturer (OEM) component data and updated component performance information can be found. This would improve the quality and identification of components and hence aid component recovery."

      "Romania s position as one of the EU member states brought new challenges in terms of industrial policy, in order to respond to the necessity of bringing the competitiveness level of the Romanianeconomy close to the average level of the European states, by respecting the free trade principles of the European Union. Furthermore, in the near future Romania should be able to contribute to the achievement of the objective of transforming EU in the most competitive economy of the world. In this order, a market – oriented industrial policy is necessary, following the European industrial policy and the sustainable development concepts adopted by the European Commission, and based on the concept of competitiveness.The general purpose of a balanced economic growth, sustainable development and improvement of the economic competitiveness requires industrial policies created and implemented in tight connection withother relevant economic policies, such as the competition policies, those aiming for a functional business environment and those encouraging the SME development and attracting FDE, the policies in the educationand research and development fields, the structural and regional policies, the commercial policies, the sustainable development and environment protection policies and those regarding employment and social cohesion."

      "In this paper we analyze equilibrium determinacy in a sticky price model in which the pass-through from policy rates to retail interest rates is sluggish and potentially incomplete. In addition, we empirically characterize and compare the interest rate pass-through process in the euro area and the U.S. We find that if the pass-through is incomplete in the long run, the standard Taylor principle is insufficient to guarantee equilibrium determinacy. Our empirical analysis indicates that this result might be particularly relevant for bank-based financial systems as for instance that in the euro area."

DM sinken, die verfügbaren Einkommen und damit der Ausgabenspielraum in entsprechendem Volumen steigen. Bisher sind allerdings die Konjunkturhoffnungen, die an diese Expansion der privaten Verbrauchsausgaben geknüpft wurden, enttäuscht worden. Maßgeblich hierfür ist die unerwartet starke Inflation. Insgesamt werden von der diesjährigen Steuersenkung keine größeren Impulse auf den Konsum ausgehen. Sie dürfte zum größten Teil lediglich die Mehrausgaben kompensieren, die den privaten Haushalte im laufenden Jahr durch die Teuerung bei Nahrungsmitteln und Energieträgern direkt und indirekt im Vergleich zum Vorjahr entstehen."

We investigate howfirm-specific and sector-specific driving forces differ by innovation type. Moreover, weoutline the functions that different innovation types have for environmental and innovationpolicies. We find that eco-innovators put relatively more attention to cost reduction, inparticular the reduction of energy and resource costs, compared to other innovators.Cost pressure and reliable, predictable and strict framework conditions of environmentalpolicy turns out to be an important driver for more incremental, firm-level eco-innovationscontributing to the diffusion of principally known technologies among firms. By contrast,more far-reaching patented eco-innovations are driven by the opportunity to create newmarkets and by government subsidies."

      "Conflict can cause negative externalities to arise, and this can result in economic loss. Such externalities are also thought to influence individuals' perceptions about economic issues. Acemoglu and Robinson (2000) provide their hypothesis that the political elite extend the franchise to avoid revolution or social unrest. For the purpose of empirically testing this hypothesis, the present paper explores how the degree of conflict between rich and poor people is associated with individual preferences for income redistribution and perceptions regarding income differences. This paper used cross-country individual-level data covering 26 countries and consisting of 20,000 observations. After controlling for individual characteristics, the key findings are as follows: (1) an individual is more likely to prefer income redistribution policy in countries where people perceive conflict between rich and poor to be high; (2) an individual is more likely to consider the income difference to be too large in countries where people perceive conflict between rich and poor to be high; and (3) after dividing the sample into high- and low-income earners, the above key findings are only obtained for high-income earners and not for low-income earners."

      "Purpose: Business accelerators have rapidly emerged as prominent players in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. A key strategic decision in designing acceleration programs is whether to customize or standardize the new venture development program (Cohen et al., 2019). Recognizing a trade-off between customization and standardization, the paper presents a multistage acceleration model aiming to harvest benefits of standardization while keeping several advantages found in tailor-made acceleration programs. Design/methodology/approach: The here-proposed 3-stage acceleration model was developed to serve the needs of the recently established business accelerator of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA). As the authors have developed and are currently implementing the 'Archimedes Multistage Acceleration Model' they act as change agents aiming to solve practical problems. This enabled the adoption of an action research approach where the aim is to produce knowledge to change social reality rather than vice versa (Allard-Poesi and Perret, 2003). To that end, the Action Innovation Management Research framework (Guertler et al., 2020) constitutes the basis of this research. Findings: The 'Archimedes Multistage Acceleration Model' proposes a 3-stage acceleration program where each stage matches a different level of maturity. For those statups positioned in the first two stages the aim is to progressively (and selectively) assist them through to the next stages. This model may be regarded as a funnel where startups are initially supported in the framework of a highly standardized acceleration program, ending gradually to receive highly tailored-made services. This design serves the needs of university accelerators that target a subset of the local startup ecosystem and aim to foster an entrepreneurship culture. Research limitations/implications: 'Archimedes Multistage Acceleration Model' was developed for, and up to this point applied at NKUA for almost a year. It is widely accepted that effectively supporting startups is a long-term process and as such a model serving this purpose requires more time to demonstrate its full potential. Furthermore, the application of the model at other universities will provide further evidence on both its value for other business accelerators and its transferability. Originality/value: Despite the growing interest in business accelerators, university accelerators remain an overlooked topic in the literature. The paper proposes a new acceleration model and presents how this is applied in the case of the Archimedes Center of NKUA. The model that harvests benefits of standardization while keeping several advantages found in tailor-made acceleration programs, is especially designed to serve the needs and the objectives of university accelerators."

      "Recent advances in biology and genetics have raised the value of life samples, health records and genetically modified micro-organisms, and, as Demsetz (1967) predicts, rising values increase the demand for well-defined exclusive ownership rights. But greater expected value of resources also fires up various claimants who compete in political, judicial and ideological domains to advance their interests. I illustrate the complex evolution of property rights in modern biotechnology (and in other fields) by analyzing the well-known case of Decode Genetics, a for-profit research firm that tried to collect all of Iceland’s health records into a central electronic database. Decode Genetics fought two rounds with the informal owners of the health records—the country’s medical establishment. The first round focused on formal institutions. In the second round, which involved informal institutions, the insiders managed to block the national databank project. Yet, the firm became renowned for its research into the genetic causes of major diseases. The paper shows that Decode Genetics was able to carry on by switching to a new game plan. Under the new strategy the firm relies on Coasean bargaining to acquire necessary genetic material and health records."

      "This paper provides the first empirical estimates of the relationship between temperatures and household electricity consumption in Colombia, using electricity billing and weather data from 2010 to 2019. I find that higher temperatures (or higher values of the heat index) increase electricity consumption, with the largest effects observed for high-income households in regions with hot climates. However, I show that there has been partial convergence between low- and highincome households, with the effect of temperature on electricity consumption in lower-income neighborhoods more than doubling between 2011 and 2019. These results align with survey evidence of increased air conditioning adoption. Nevertheless, further growth in air conditioning adoption and use is required to alleviate the health effects of more frequent and severe heatwaves due to climate change."

      "China's central government has rightfully recognized that successful urbanization will be decisive for the nation's future development. However, most city regions in China are not yet enjoying the net benefits that agglomerations in metropolitan regions can initiate. In this regard, following the latest discussions around the necessity of inclusive urban growth in China, the paper calls for a housing strategy that accommodates the surging waves of rural to urban migration, one of the main drivers of urbanization, and that provides migrants with greater urban socio-economic opportunities, improves migrants' urban prospects in order to facilitate a growing urban middle class as well as directing urban growth. Therefore, migrants' characteristics and their exposure to the immediate urban socio-economic environment are elaborated upon in order to understand migrants' housing priorities along their rural to urban transition. These housing priorities are the result of coping strategies in the face of distinctive urban opportunities and threats. In the context of migration, they form the underlying forces of housing demand development along the rural to urban transition. Eventually, when identified, these forces can be triggered in a way that enables urban growth to contribute to agglomeration benefits. This paper adds to the previous IPE working paper: \"Urbanization in China and how urban housing demand can be met\", by specifying the underlying forces of evolving migrant housing demands."

      "Domestic politics in Togo in 2012 were dominated by the upcoming legislative and local elections and irreconcilable differences between the ruling party on the one hand and a broad coalition of opposition parties and civil society organisations on the other. Under the growing momentum of regular anti-government demonstrations, often violently suppressed, the call for the resignation of President Faure Gnassingbé and political change became more articulate. In foreign affairs, the pro-Western stance of the government was increasingly valued by international donors in view of the growing threat of terrorism in the neighbouring Sahel. Promising growth prospects led the government and its majority in parliament to vote an ambitious budget for 2013.",
      "Die Innenpolitik Togos war 2012 geprägt von den bevorstehenden Parlaments- und Kommunalwahlen sowie den unüberbrückbaren Differenzen zwischen der Regierungspartei einerseits und einer breiten Koalition aus Oppositionsparteien und zivilgesellschaftlichen Organisationen andererseits. Im Zuge der wachsenden Dynamik regelmäßiger, oft gewaltsam niedergeschlagener Demonstrationen gegen die Regierung wurden die Forderungen nach dem Rücktritt von Präsident Faure Gnassingbé und einem politischen Wandel immer lauter. In der Außenpolitik wurde die prowestliche Haltung der Regierung angesichts der wachsenden Bedrohung durch den Terrorismus in der benachbarten Sahelzone von internationalen Geldgebern zunehmend geschätzt. Vielversprechende Wachstumsaussichten veranlassten die Regierung und ihre Mehrheit im Parlament, einen ehrgeizigen Haushalt für 2013 zu verabschieden."

      "The main aim of the research is to continue the studies on promising technologies of coal conversion into synthetic liquid fuel (methanol). The object of study is the plants for combined production of electricity and synthetic liquid fuel (PCPs), which are eco-friendly and more efficient as compared to the plants for separate production. The previous studies on PCPs consider the systems for fine cleaning of gasification products in a simplified way. This study presents the detailed mathematical modeling of the aforementioned systems and determines the values of energy consumption and investment in them. The obtained values are used to carry out the optimization studies and find the optimal parameters of PCPs with different degree of CO2 removal from gasification products providing fine cleaning of gasification products from H2S."

      "In the EU telecommunications regulatory framework a strong intention to avoid overregulation with respect to new markets can be observed. However, a clear-cut economically based analysis of the remaining need for sector-specific regu-lation is still missing. In this paper, the question is analyzed whether new mar-kets create new monopolistic bottlenecks or extend the borderlines of existing bottlenecks. Three kinds of transmission qualities on service markets can be dif-ferentiated according to the products provided: narrowband services like PSTN/ISDN or GSM, semi high-speed broadband services like broadband inter-net access up to 6 Mbps download and VDSL services up to 50 Mbps. As long as, due to the absence of alternative network infrastructures, a monopolistic bot-tleneck in local infrastructure networks exists the question arises what the re-maining bottleneck components are for these different markets. In this paper we will demonstrate the shrinking-bottleneck hypothesis."

      "Food for Education (FFE) programmes have been implemented in developing countries since the 1960s. This paper examines the impact of the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) school feeding programme on pupils' attendance and girls' enrolment rate within primary schools in northern Burkina Faso. Using difference-in-difference (DID) estimation with the data set on the Beoog Biiga programme, we find that take-home rations (THRs) increased school attendance for both boys and girls. Moreover, the findings show that girls' enrolment rate within schools increased by 3.2 per cent. This is driven by the increase in the number of newly enrolled girls compared with boys. We conclude that THRs have the potential to increase girls' educational attainment and gender equality within schools."

      "On global scale, central banks' holdings of foreign reserves have escalated sharply in recent years. World international reserves holdings have risen significantly from US$1.2 trillion in 1995 to nearly US$10.0 trillion in June 2011. Dominant among these reserves are concentrated in the hands of few countries. Ten major holders of foreign reserves are mostly from Asia. Oil exporting countries in Africa and the Middle East are not left out in this trend. Nigeria's foreign reserves rose from US$5.5 billion in 1999 to US$62.40 billion in July 2008, making Nigeria the twenty-fourth largest reserves holder in the world. This pace of reserves accumulation is occurring without regard to its diminishing marginal benefits and rising marginal costs. This study used an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach to run a slightly modified econometrics \"Buffer Stock Model\" of Frenkel and Jovanovic (1981) to estimate the determinants of foreign reserves in Nigeria with focus on income, monetary policy rate, imports and exchange rate. The results debunked the existence of buffer stock model for reserves accumulation and provide strong evidence in support of income as the major determinant of reserves holdings in Nigeria."

      "In this paper, we argue that the effect of governance on the emergence of crimes of different levels of sophistication is highly non-linear. State failure, anarchy and a lack of infrastructure are not conducive to establishing any business, including illicit enterprises. At the bottom of the spectrum, therefore, both legal business and criminal gangs benefit from improved governance. With further improvements in governance criminal activities decline. We find strong and consistent support for this hypothesis using the International Maritime Bureau's dataset on piracy. Piracy is reported by ship-owners, giving a unique insight into crime in badly governed countries which were systematically excluded from previous analyses. We show that profitable forms of piracy flourish where on the one hand there is stability and infrastructure, but on the other hand the state does not have the capacity to intervene and/or bureaucrats can be bribed to turn a blind eye. For minor acts of theft from ships the pattern is quadratic: piracy first rises and then falls as governance improves."

      "This experimental study investigates how behavior changes after punishment for an unkind action. It also studies how fairness perceptions affect the reaction to punishment and whether this effect is consistent across repeated play and role experiences. A repeated version of the power-to-take game is used. In this game, the proposer can make a claim on the resources of a responder. Then, the responder can destroy any part of her own resources. The focus is on how proposers adjust their behavior depending on their fairness perceptions, their experienced emotions, and their interaction with responders. We find that fairness plays an important role in the behavior of proposers. Specifically, deviations from a perceived fairness norm trigger feelings of shame and guilt, which induce proposers to lower their claims. However, we also find that the perceived fairness norm varies considerably between individuals. Therefore, it is not the case that proposers who considered they were acting fairly were particularly nice to responders. Our results also show that the different types of individuals predicted by models of social preferences, can be traced among the subjects that played the same role in both periods, but fail to describe the behavior of subjects who switched from one role to the other."

      "The interest rate is set by the central bank with a view to securing a nominal anchor for the economy in the long term. The setting of interest rates is based on evaluations of economic trends and the balance of risks. In some periods, the assessment of economic prospects and the balance of risks can change considerably. This may be due to three factors: sizeable revisions to economic data series, new information, or just a change in perceptions. In the 1970s, forecasts of productivity growth in the US were way off the mark. The boom period in Norway in the mid-1980s was first identified after the peak had been passed. The reunification of East and West Germany reversed what one thought would be an economic upturn in Europe to a downturn. The projected cyclical downturn in Norway at the turn of the millennium was over before it actually started. The basis for interest rate setting has not been perfect in these periods. What consequences has this had for monetary policy? Have monetary policy decisions been inappropriate? The answer is that sometimes things have gone wrong, while other times the monetary policy strategy has been sufficiently robust. Limited information is one argument for proceeding gradually when making monetary policy adjustments. When historians are to pass judgement on monetary policy, it is also important to assess policy on the basis of the information available when the decisions were taken. Monetary policy is conducted in real time and not retrospectively."

      "Household debt in Korea raises concerns about the resilience of the economy due to its size and quality. Against this backdrop, we investigate if household leverage matters for private consumption in adverse economic environments even without severe financial disruptions. We find that the balance sheet positions in terms of the leverage ratio may weaken consumption growth. We also find that the depressive effect of debt on consumption may differ across types of consumer spending and household characteristics. In particular, the effects of indebtedness have been much stronger in relation to durable goods expenditures than in other areas. In addition, debtors in highincome (wealth) groups have also shown downward adjustments in consumption even more so than low-income (wealth) groups. These findings imply that debtors' precautionary behavior may serve as an important channel from leverage to consumer spending."

      "This paper examines the effect of different crimes on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows into the 32 Mexican states. Using a state-quarter panel data for the period 2005 to 2015, we estimate alternative models of FDI, with fixed effects throughout a flexible lag-lengths methodology and System Generalized Method of Moments (SGMM) models in order to identify the determinants of FDI inflows into the country. The dependent variable in our model is the annual inflow of FDI and the independent variables are state level indicators (real wages and electricity consumption), and macroeconomic forces (the real exchange rate and interest rate). We find that homicides and thefts have negative statistically significant effects on FDI, while other crimes show no effects. Partitions of the sample suggest higher negative effects in the most violent states."

      "This study examines the impact of international economic sanctions, imposed on Iran due to its nuclear program, on the development of the middle class. Specifically, it investigates how the middle class in Iran would have developed in the absence of these sanctions post-2012. To address this question, we employ a synthetic control model to create a counterfactual scenario for Iran, using a weighted average of other comparable countries that mirror pre-sanction Iran, but did not experience significant international sanctions. By comparing the middle-class size of this counterfactual Iran with the actual Iran that faced major economic sanctions, our results indicate that the annual middle-class size would have been approximately 11 percentage points larger, on average, without the post-2012 sanctions. Our findings are robust across various tests, including placebo tests and synthetic difference-in-difference analyses. The latter analysis shows that the estimated average effect of sanctions on the middle-class size of Iran from 2012 to 2019 is highly statistically significant. Finally, we provide evidence on the relevance of real GDP per capita and merchandise imports as key selected channels through which sanctions negatively affect the size of the middle class."

      "The adoption of improved technologies in agriculture has been shown to improve incomes, reduce poverty and contribute to rural development in many developing nations. In Togo, the Agricultural Sector Support Project (PASA) assists smallholder farmers in the adoption of the Improved Technology in Traditional Poultry Farming (ITTPF) in rural areas as a means of increasing smallholder incomes, enhancing food security and reducing poverty. However, the adoption rate is currently below expectations, especially given the promise it holds not only from an economic perspective but also from a broad environmental sustainability viewpoint since poultry manure can be used as a necessary input in smallholder farms. In this study, we examine the factors associated with the participation of farmers in PASA for the adoption of ITTPF in Togo. Our analysis covers 400 smallholder households in the 23 districts of Togo and employs Logit model with Probit model as robustness check. We find different socio-economic constraints and enablers of participation in PASA. Particularly, level of education, household size, membership in cooperative societies, hatching rate of eggs, farm size, average annual sale of poultry and self-financing capacity were positively and significantly related to the participation of farmers in PASA. The findings are robust to alternative specifications such as Probit model. Based on the findings, we argue that participation in agricultural innovation and development programs depends on the information accessible to farmers. One medium to improve information access could be agricultural cooperatives and extension services since they provide informal education, training, and access to productive inputs for farming and marketing purposes. Our findings suggest the need for agricultural policies which promote farmer organizations such as agricultural cooperatives coupled with effective extension services to enable the adoption of improved agricultural technologies."

      "This paper uses a dataset from one of the largest credit card issuers in Brazil to investigate the extent of credit constraints for one of the world's largest emerging market economies. In order to deal with the endogeneity problem from an observational dataset, an identification strategy based on the issuer actual policies was used to better identify the long run effects of a credit card limit increase on debt. The results point to a long run effect of credit limit on credit card debts of 0.1144, a similar size to the ones found in Gross and Souleles (2001). This value indicates the Permanent Income Hypothesis is rejected for this sample, and some evidence supporting a variation of buffer stock behavior is found. Furthermore, results indicate the degree of heterogeneity in effects is much higher than similar results for developed countries, lending credence to the conclusion credit constraints are much stronger for lower income groups. This conclusion is in line to previous studies in Brazil, such as de Lucinda and Vieira (2014)."

      "During the last three decades there has been an almost continuous undermining of the public interest by private interests operating either outside or inside Greek public administration. The result of this infiltration has been a gradual loss of bureaucratic autonomy to pursue the public interest. The web of relationships developed between private interests and the two dominant political parties have eroded both the efficacy of public administration and the dynamism of the private sector as incumbent firms and public (or quasi-public) sector functionaries have been using their power to prevent the birth of new firms and to raid the state coffers. The upshot of these have been the emergence of permanently large budget and current account deficits, which have in turn driven Greece's foreign indebtedness to alarming levels, necessitating the current bailout by the EU/ECB/IMF."

      "We estimate the impact of schooling on monthly earnings from 1950 to 2000 in Romania. Nearly constant at about 3-4% during the socialist period, the coefficient on schooling in a conventional earnings regression rises steadily during the 1990s, reaching 8.5% by 2000. Our analysis finds little evidence for either the standard explanations of such an increase in the West (labor supply movements, product demand shifts, technical change) or the transition-specific accounts sometimes offered (wage liberalization, border opening, increased quality of education). But we find some support for institutional and organizational explanations, particularly the high productivity of education in restructuring and entrepreneurial activities in a disequilibrium environment."

      "All aspects of banking business are being radically transformed and to an extent that is changing the fundamental economics of the banking firm and the banking industry. This is because of three dominant factors: a series of powerful pressures acting simultaneously; technology is changing the very core of banking business: infor-mation advantages, processing, moni-toring, delivery, etc; and because, as a result of these pressures, competition is increasingly developing from outside the traditional banking industry. The paper reviews the pressures impinging on the economics of banking and considers their implications for the structure of the banking industry; the business operations of banks, and the structure of the banking firm.\""

      "Der Deka-S-Finanzklima wurde in der Coronapandemie entwickelt und ermöglicht durchdie breite Erhebung auf Top-Managementebene eine Reflektion bzgl. der Einschätzung zur Wirtschaftslage inDeutschland. Insgesamt zeigt sich, dass die Folgen der Coronapandemie zwar belasten, die weiteren Umfeldbedingungen(insbesondere die Negativzins-Beeinträchtigungen) hinterließen und hinterlassen jedoch deutlichereSpuren. Der Sparkassensektor ist einer der wesentlichen Finanzierer des – insbesondere in Deutschlandbestehenden – Mittelstandes. Die Einlagenkonditionen der Sparkassen, mit einer Zinsbelastung oberhalb desMarkzinsniveaus, sind die mittelbaren Einstandskosten für die Finanzierung des Mittelstandes. Die Herausforderungin der Steuerung des Zinsgeschäfts besteht u. a. darin, dass negative Konditionsbeiträge im Einlagengeschäftrealisiert werden und sich die Kapitalbindung der Passiva erheblich reduziert hat. Die Kreditnehmerhingegen haben Bedarf an längeren Zins- und Kapitalbindungen. Dem folgend entstehen potentielle Liquiditäts-und Ertragsrisiken für die Sparkassen bei der Durchführung ihres öffentlichen Auftrags die Wirtschaft mitKrediten zu unterstützen.",
      "The Deka financial climate was developed during the corona pandemic and, thanks to its broadbasedsurvey at top management level, enables a reflection on the assessment of the economic situation inGermany. Overall, it can be seen that while the consequences of the corona pandemic are having a negativeimpact, other economic conditions, in particular the burdens caused by negative interest rates, have left andcontinue to leave clearer traces. The savings bank sector is one of the main financiers of Small- and MidsizedEnterprises (SMEs) especially those in Germany. The deposit conditions of the savings banks, with interestcharges above the market interest rate level are the indirect initial costs for financing SMEs. One of thechallenges in managing the interest rate business is that negative condition contributions are being realized inthe deposit business and that the capital commitment of liabilities has been significantly reduced. Borrowers, on the other hand, have a need for longer interest rate and capital commitments. This gives rise to potential liquidityand earnings risks for the savings banks in carrying out their public mandate to support the economy with loans."

      "The report focuses on civil society experience with locally identified priorities for poverty eradication, an area little examined and less discussed in the international debate on PRSP to date. In the three N/S PRSP Programme countries, Honduras, Nicaragua and Zambia, civil society organisations have been involved in efforts to identify national as well as local priorities for poverty eradication. Taking the point of departure in involvement of CS with PRSP planning and monitoring at both levels, the paper presents a range of challenges and dilemmas for civil society in its efforts to combat poverty. Special attention is given to civil society initiatives and response to PRSP in provinces, districts and communities. In the three countries civil society organisations carry out projects aimed at poverty eradication at local levels, some initiated in relation to PRSPs, some initiated regardless of and before initiation of the national PRSP process. Three areas stand out as critical for local CSOs: (i) Women’s contributions must be regarded as an asset in poverty eradication, (ii) Focus on rural development – support to peasants and other small producers, (iii) Promotion of local production and local trade. Major efforts of civil society organisations (and INGOs) have been directed upwards towards lobbying at national and international levels. While well justified, this focus advances the risk of neglecting local civil society initiatives in communities and districts. There is a need to support a process that encourages citizens and local civil society organisations to engage in a long-term commitment in municipalities and villages."

      "Germany is one of the several countries in Europe that have opened its borders to immigrants for many years. The admission of immigrants into Germany has contributed to the country being the second largest immigration destination in the world, and this has resulted in both negative and positive outcomes for the natives. In this essay, the effect of immigration on natives' hourly wages and employment was examined, by using microdata for Germany. Native workers' educational level attainments and 16 different regions in Germany were taken into account to obtain regional variation. Cross-sectional data was used for the years 2005, 2009 and 2015 in order to measure the effect of the share of immigrants on natives' hourly wages and employment. The findings showed that the share of immigrants, had a positive effect on natives' wages and employment in 2005 and 2009. In 2015, however, a negative relationship was found, with the share of immigrants impacting negatively on natives' wages but not on employment. Thus, the study highlights the importance of immigrants on natives' hourly wages and employment."

      "We analyze cross-country trends in technological progress over the period of 1980-2011 by examining citations data from almost 4 million utility patents granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Our estimation results on patent quality and distance to the knowledge frontier reveal the following stylized facts. The emerging Asian economies of Korea, Taiwan and China have indeed achieved substantial catch-up towards the technology frontier. In the case of Korea and Taiwan, progress has been made in terms of patent quality as well as distance to the frontier. Chinese patents are of higher quality now than before but Chinese inventors have yet to reduce the citation lag relative to the frontier. In contrast, advanced economies of Europe and Japan have displayed steady decline in their patent quality. Finally, the US has maintained, and in some cases strengthened, its position as the world technology frontier"

      "This paper investigates the impacts of regional integration processes on poverty in Bolivia. It first demonstrates that regional integration has stimulated a diversion of trade away from traditional US and EU markets towards countries of MERCOSUR and the Andean Community. At the same time, the composition of exports has changed from predominantly minerals towards slightly more elaborated goods, such as vegetable fats, food and beverages. The paper presents econometric analyses of the impact of imports, exports and FDI (by sector, and trade block) on individual labor incomes and household poverty status. The results show that higher exports generally tend to benefit the workers who work in the exporting sectors. However, this result only holds for export sectors that exploit some natural resource rents (mining, hydrocarbons, modern agriculture), and not for those which rely purely on low wages in order to be competitive (most manufacturing sectors). Imports typically have a negative effect on worker salaries, except the imports of capital goods, which do not compete with local production. This implies that the change towards more regional trade of goods with a smaller natural resource rent component is unlikely to contribute to a reduction in poverty. For exports and FDI to be helpful for reducing poverty, they would have to focus on sectors, which are labor intensive and at the same time exploit some natural resource rents. Sectors that might fulfill these criteria are modern agriculture and tourism."

      "This paper takes a systematic look at the economic impact of the crisis that started in earnest in the fall of 2008 across countries and regions. Despite warnings of growing domestic and external imbalances in many countries years ahead of the crisis, the massive impact of the crisis came as a surprise to most. By correlating economic performance in the crisis with an extensive set of early warning, country insurance, and policy indicators, this paper provides some lessons on crisis prevention and management for the future. Although significant efforts have been made to develop robust early warnings systems, the paper shows the mixed success of some commonly analyzed indicators in predicting economic outcomes in this crisis. The only robust early warning indicator was increases in real estate prices while international reserves seem to have insured against the worst crisis outcomes on average. However, much work on building a robust early warning system remains and the analytical and empirical challenges in this area are substantial. The issues confronting early warning systems are also relevant to the more recent field of macro prudential supervision and regulation. Nevertheless, the cost of crises is massive and preventing future ones with better regulation, policies and supervision based on solid research must be a top priority among policy makers and academics alike."

      "Le mouvement social en Haïti pâtit depuis plusieurs décennies de l’absence d’un acteur majeur, les classes moyennes, dont l’appauvrissement et le déclin sont en train de donner naissance à d’importantes mutations sociales, économiques et politiques dans ce pays. L’action combinée des politiques néolibérales appliquées en Haïti et la récurrence des catastrophes naturelles ont conduit à la décapitalisation et à l’appauvrissement des classes moyennes. Le déclin des classes moyennes a facilité l’accès des élites économiques au contrôle des institutions étatiques. Ceci a contribué à délégitimer l’Etat aux yeux des populations, à réduire considérablement l’influence des classes moyennes dans la définition de politiques publiques et à faire reculer le mouvement social. L’objectif de cette étude est d’analyser les causes de l’affaissement des classes moyennes d’ancienne souche et ses conséquences sur la dynamique sociale et économique qui avait été enclenchée à la chute de la dictature des Duvalier en 1986. Elle est structurée de la façon suivante. Dans un premier temps, nous ferons un bref rappel des approches de la classe moyenne. On comprendra que les caractéristiques des classes moyennes ainsi que les stratégies qu’elles ont adoptées portent les marques du système politique ainsi que les transformations de l’ordre économique qui ont été en vigueur au cours du long XIXème siècle haïtien. Dans un deuxième temps, on abordera la situation de ces classes au cours de la période contemporaine en prenant en compte les mutations qu’a connues la société haïtienne au cours des trois dernières décennies, mutations qui expliquent pourquoi ce groupe social est confronté aujourd’hui à un processus d’affaissement qui a tout l’air d’être irréversible. Dans un troisième temps, nous analyserons les conséquences de cet affaissement sur la société haïtienne et sur ses capacités à renouer avec un projet de réforme politique, économique et sociale."

      "It is well documented that a large share of new products does not survive their first year in the market. Research reported in this paper examined the relationship between product quality and innovation success. In contrast to existing product innovation literature that focused on industrial goods, this study used food product data from a 2002 German food manufacturing firm survey. Results of Sample Selection Model suggest that premium quality increases product's success rate. Furthermore, firm size has a significant positive impact on success rate. Intensity of competition as well as retailers? market power reduce product?s success rate."

      "The conflict between Russia and Ukraine that started in March 2014 resulted in bilateral economic sanctions imposed by Russia and Western countries, including the members of the euro area (EA). The paper investigates the impact of sanctions on the real side of the economy of Russia and the EA. Using an index that measures intensity of sanctions the effects of sanctions shocks are analyzed by the means of structural vector autoregression. The direct effect on GDP growth is documented for Russia but not for the EA. While, on average, 1.97% of the GDP quarter-on-quarter growth is estimated to be lost due to sanctions by Russia, the corresponding estimate for the aggregate EA is very small. On the contrary, the indirect effect through depreciation of the currency is shown to be more important for the EA."

      "Resource-based models of species competition predict that when species compete for a limiting resource in a homogeneous habitat, then the equilibrium outcome is a monoculture with the species characterised by the lowest resource requirement outcompeting all the rest. We derive harvesting rules for a habitat that maximise the utility flows generated from consumption activities of the harvested species, and from nonconsumptive activities associated with utility generated from positive species biomass. Under the harvesting rules the maximal desired biodiversity is preserved in the long-run equilibrium assembly. Our harvesting rule at the steady state corresponds to a golden biodiversity rule. The equilibrium assembly is characterised by a 'strong resilience principle' in both deterministic and stochastic environments, indicating that irrespective of the initial state of the assembly, the system tends to the steady state where full biodiversity is preserved."

      "In this paper we examine determinants of prepaid modes of health care financing in a worldwide cross-country perspective. We use three different indicators to capture the role of prepaid modes in health care financing: (i) the share of total prepaid financing as percent of total current health expenditures, (ii) the share of voluntary prepaid financing as percent of total prepaid financing, and (iii) the share of compulsory health insurance as percent of total compulsory financing arrangements. We refer to a panel data set comprising 158 countries and covering the time period 2000-2015. We apply a static as well as a dynamic panel data model. We find that the current structure of prepaid financing is significantly determined by its different forms in the past. The significant influence of governmental revenues, development assistance for health and regulatory quality varies depending on the financing structure we look at. The country's GDP per capita, the agricultural value added, the degree of urbanization and the share of the elderly are only of minor importance for explaining the variation in a country's structure of health care financing. From our analysis we conclude that more detailed information on indicators which reflect the distribution of individual characteristics (such as income and health risks) within a country's population would be needed to gain deeper insight into the decisive determinants for prepaid health care financing."

      "Recent theoretical contributions have suggested consumption externalities, or peergroup effects, as a potential explanation for some of the puzzles in macroeconomics and finance. However, the empirical relevance of peer effects for intertemporal consumption choice is a completely open question. To shed some light on the issue, we derive an extension of the standard life-cycle model that allows for consumption externalities. The analysis is complicated by the challenge of disentangling actual peer effects from merely correlated effects operating through common features or shocks within peer groups. We show how to conduct reliable inference under these circumstances based on within-group equilibrium conditions that give rise to a social multiplier. This approach can be understood as an adaptation of Manski's reflection problem framework to the case of dynamic models with endogenous regressors. We estimate our model using US panel data from the PSID. While there is strong predictable consumption co-movement within peer groups, the evidence for true consumption externalities vanishes once correlated effects are adequately accounted for."

      "This paper provides a novel rationale for the regulation of market size when heterogeneous firms compete. A regulator seeks to maximize total welfare by choosing the number of firms allowed to enter the market, e.g. by issuing a certain number of licenses. Opening up the market for more firms has a two-fold effect: it increases competition and thus welfare, but at the same time, it also attracts more cost-intensive firms, driving down average production efficiency. The regulator hence faces a trade-off between raising beneficial competition and detrimental costs. If goods are sufficiently substitutable, the latter effect can outweigh the former. It is then optimal to restrict the market size, rationalizing a limit to competition. This result holds even in the absence of entry costs, search costs or increasing returns to scale, which previous literature required."

      "This paper examines how Science and Technology (S&T) contribute to job creation in the Chinese manufacturing sector. The ambition of transforming China into an innovation-oriented nation and the emphasis on indigenous innovation capacity building have placed Science and Technology (S&T) high on the Chinese policy agenda. At the same time, the need for job creation is pressing, both to absorb the huge supply of underemployed people, and to enable the annual 20 million new labor market entrants to find employment. We examine the relationship between S&T and job growth in the Chinese industrial sector. S&T can be expected to have both positive and negative effects on employment. For instance, new technology might increase competitiveness and enable Chinese firms to expand their labor force. On the other hand, new technology might be labor-saving, thereby enabling Chinese firms to produce more output with fewer employees. Based on a large sample of manufacturing firms in China between 1998 and 2004, we analyze how S&T affect employment growth. Our results suggest that S&T activities have no effect on job creation."

      "This paper studies the efficacy of immigrant selection based on skill requirements in the Canadian context. The point system results in a much higher skill level than would otherwise be achieved by family preferences. This positive selection is achieved by directly selecting higher skilled principal applicants who are assessed by the point system and also indirectly through higher skilled spouses. However, due to difficulties in transfer of foreign human capital immigrants admitted for their skills do not necessarily perform better in the labour market and important factors used to assess admissibility have very limited power to predict short-term labour market success."

      "In a game with rational expectations, individuals simultaneously refine their information with the information revealed by the strategies of other individuals. At a Nash equilibrium of a game with rational expectations, the information of individuals is essentially symmetric: the same profile of strategies is also an equilibrium of a game with symmetric information; and strategies are common knowledge. If each player has a veto act, which yields a minimum payoff that no other profile of strategies attains, then the veto profile is the only Nash equilibrium, and it is an equilibrium with rational expectations and essentially symmetric information; which accounts for the impossibility of speculation."

      "Smith et al. (1988) reported large bubbles and crashes in experimental asset markets, a result that has been replicated by a large literature. Here we test whether the occurrence of bubbles depends on the experimental subjects' cognitive sophistication. In a two-part experiment, we first run a battery of tests to assess the subjects' cognitive sophistication and classify them into low or high levels of cognitive sophistication. We then invite them separately to two asset market experiments populated only by subjects with either low or high cognitive sophistication. We observe classic bubble- crash patterns in the sessions populated by subjects with low levels of cognitive sophistication. Yet, no bubbles or crashes are observed with our sophisticated subjects. This result lends strong support to the view that the usual bubbles and crashes in experimental asset markets are caused by subjects' confusion and, therefore, raises some doubts about the external validity of this type of experiments."

      "We develop a model which shows that wages, prices and real income should grow faster in countries with low increase in their labour force. If not, other countries experience growing unemployment and/or trade deficit. This result is applied to the case of Germany, which has displayed a significantly lower increase in its labour force than its trade partners, except in the moment of the reunification. By assuming that goods are differentiated according to their country of origin (Armington's hypothesis), a low growth of the working population constrains the production of German goods, which entails an increase in their prices and in German wages. This mechanism is magnified by the low price elasticity of the demand for German goods. Hence, the German policy of wage moderation could severely constrain other countries' policy options. The simulations of an extended model which encompasses offshoring to emerging countries and labour market imperfections suggest that (i) the impact of differences in labour force growth upon unemployment in Eurozone countries has been significant and (ii) the German demographic shock following unification could explain a large part of the 1995-2005 German economic turmoil."

      "Im Zuge einer sich dramatisch verschärfenden Wirtschaftslage zerbrachen Ende der 80er Jahre die politischen und wirtschaftlichen Strukturen der bis dahin kommunistisch regierten Länder Mittel- und Osteuropas. Angesichts des Scheiterns der zentralverwaltungswirtschaftlichen Ordnung blieb als Ausweg aus der Systemkrise nur die Transformation des Wirtschaftssystems in eine Marktwirtschaft westlicher Prägung. Fast ein Jahrzehnt nach Beginn des Reformprozesses soll die vorliegende Analyse Aufschluß darüber geben, ob die Einführung der marktwirtschaftlichen Ordnung in den mittel- und osteuropäischen Ländern gelungen ist und ob diese Anschluß an die Einkommensentwicklung westlicher Marktwirtschaften gefunden haben. Um Aussagen über Erfolg oder Mißerfolg treffen zu können, wird als Meßlatte für die Reformpolitik ein marktwirtschaftliches Referenzsystem entwickelt, das die wesentlichen Elemente einer marktwirtschaftlichen Ordnung enthält. Auf diese Weise wird eine ordnungspolitische Soll-Ist-Analyse möglich, die sich auf die relativ weit fortgeschrittenen Reformländer Polen, Tschechische und Slowakische Republik sowie Ungarn erstreckt. Durch einen Ländervergleich werden zudem Reformunterschiede und typische Merkmale des Reformprozesses herausgearbeitet. Inwieweit die ordnungspolitischen Weichenstellungen geeignet waren, einen wirtschaftlichen Aufholprozeß gegenüber den westlichen Industrieländern einzuleiten, zeigt ergänzend eine Analyse der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung in den betrachteten Reformländern."

      "The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has brought significant change to people's lives and business activities nationally, regionally, and globally. The Philippines took swift action-including enhanced community quarantine (ECQ)-to contain the pandemic and launched an emergency subsidy program with massive public spending to support disrupted households and businesses. The strict lockdown ran from mid-March to the end of May 2020 in the national capital region and high-risk provinces, causing huge economic losses. Six months after the March lockdown, the Philippine economy has moved to the recovery stage, but micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) are continuing to confront a sharp drop in demand and revenue. This paper examines the initial impact on MSMEs of the ECQ and lockdown measures using evidence obtained from a rapid nationwide survey conducted from the end of March to mid-April 2020 and derives policy implications."

      "We document the individual willingness to act against climate change and study the role of social norms in a large sample of US adults. Individual beliefs about social norms positively predict pro-climate donations, comparable in strength to universal moral values and economic preferences such as patience and reciprocity. However, we document systematic misperceptions of social norms. Respondents vastly underestimate the prevalence of climate-friendly behaviors and norms. Correcting these misperceptions in an experiment causally raises individual willingness to act against climate change as well as individual support for climate policies. The effects are strongest for individuals who are skeptical about the existence and threat of global warming."

      "The paper analyses the effect of interest rate changes on education and child labor in an economy with a high-skilled sector, a low-skilled sector and fragmented credit markets. The high-skilled sector takes educated labor as input. The low-skilled sector takes unskilled labor, physical capital and natural common-pool resources as inputs. Credit supply consists of (a) loans with collateral in form of productive investments in the low-skilled sector and (b) higher-priced loans without collateral. Lower interest rates increase the net present value of the returns to education. They also reduce costs of capital investment in current production. This increases labor productivity and the opportunity costs of education. Overuse of the common-pool resource can reverse this productivity effect. We show that the overall effect of interest rate changes on education depends on the initial wealth of the household, resource use and the credit market segment that is subject to improvements."

      "In this paper, we use stochastic dynamic programming to model the choice of a municipality which has to design an optimal waste management program under uncertainty about the price of recyclables in the secondary market. The municipality can, by undertaking an irreversible investment, adopt a flexible program which integrates the existing landfill strategy with recycling, keeping the option to switch back to landfilling, if profitable. We determine the optimal share of waste to be recycled and the optimal timing for the investment in such a flexible program. We find that adopting a flexible program rather than a non-flexible one, the municipality: i) invests in recycling capacity under circumstances where it would not do so otherwise; ii) invests earlier, and iii) benefits from a higher expected net present value."

      "This paper focuses on the role of home country's birth rates in shaping immigrants' fertility. We use the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) to study completed fertility of first generation immigrants who arrived from different countries and at different times. We find that women from countries where the aggregate birth rate is high tend to have significantly more children than women from countries with low birth rates. This relationship is attenuated by selection operating towards destination country. In addition, the fertility rates of source countries explain a large proportion of fertility differentials between immigrants and German natives. The results suggest that home country's culture affects immigrants' long-run outcomes and therefore favor the socialization hypothesis."

      "Most ‘wage curve’ studies treat local labour markets as independent ‘islands’ in the national economy. However, when a local labour market is in close proximity of other labour markets, a local shock that increases unemployment may not lead to lower pay rates if employers fear outward migration of their workers. Hence, the unemployment elasticity of pay will be greater, the more isolated the local labour market is. Wages are also expected to be higher in regions that interact strongly with other regions. These hypotheses are confirmed by means of an estimation of wage curves with data for 327 regions of western Germany over the period 1990-97.

      "Policy makers are increasingly concerned about the combination of market power and massive data collection in digital markets. This concern is fueled by the theoretical prediction that more market power causes firms to collect ever more data from their users. We investigate the relationship between market power and data collection empirically. We analyze data about more than 1.5 million mobile applications in several thousand submarkets of Google's Play Store. We observe these data for over two years and combine information on an app's data collection with information about its competitive environment. Our analysis highlights a robust positive relationship between market power and data collection. We find that more data are being collected in concentrated markets, and apps with higher market shares collect more data. This pattern robustly emerges across a series of cross-sectional and panel regressions as well as a series of specifications that exploit exogenous variation."

      "This paper aims to identify the most effective mode of development finance flows for the economic growth of middle-income developing and least developed countries, separately. It also attempts to confirm whether governance has any significant role in the causal relationship between development finance flows and economic growth. Policymakers in each developing country should select the most effective modality of development finance inflows among the different modalities (such as Official Development Assistance (ODA) grants, Official Development Assistance (ODA) loans, FDI, and international personal remittances) and expand it for their economic growth. Dynamic panel regression models were used on 48 least developed countries and 89 middle-income developing countries, respectively, during the Millennium Development Era: 2000-2015. The empirical analysis results show that ODA grants and remittances were most effective in promoting economic growth for least developed countries, while FDI was most effective for middle-income developing countries. These findings were not affected by the status of governance of the individual country."

      "There is a concern among social scientists and policymakers that the COVID-19 crisis might permanently change the nature of work. We study how labor demand in Mexico has been affected during the pandemic by web scraping job ads from a leading job search website. As in the U.S., the number of vacancies in Mexico declined sharply during the lockdown (38 percent). In April there was a change in the composition of labor demand, and wages dropped across the board. By May, however, the wage distribution and the distribution of job ads by occupation returned to their pre-pandemic levels. Overall, there was a slight decline in specific requirements (gender and age), no change in required experience, and a temporary increase in demand for low-skilled workers. Contrary to expectations, opportunities for telecommuting diminished during the pandemic. Using a simple Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, we find that the variation in the average advertised wage in April is explained more by a higher proportion of low-wage occupations than by a reduction in the wages paid for particular occupations. In sum, we find no evidence of a significant or permanent change in labor demand during the pandemic in Mexico."

      "Achieving an affordable clean energy in accordance to the sustainable development goal (SDG 7) is a challenge in Nigeria and other nations in Africa. Most of the currently used energy strategies are either not sustainable or poorly maintained. Nigeria is a major exporter of fossil fuel but currently faced with serious energy crisis, which necessitates the search for a sustainable renewable form of energy as alternative to fossil fuel in order to meet the SDG 7. Biofuel has been identified as a sustainable form of renewable energy in Nigeria with sugarcane, cassava, plant seed and waste materials being possible feedstocks for bioethanol and biodiesel production. The feedstocks are predominantly available and accessible with the possibility of maximizing them to drive socio-economic growth. Use of waste materials and non-edible underutilized seed oil such as Jatropha curcas will help minimize the controversies associated with the use of food materials as feedstock for biofuel production in Nigeria and other nations in Africa. Furthermore, focus should be on developing the Nigerian waste management strategy, which has the potential of generating sufficient energy to drive the economy and serve as means of employment. It is also high time for Nigeria to develop its own technology to run biofuel production from its currently developed cassava and sugarcane industry. It might be necessary to create more awareness on the importance of biofuel as well as provide suitable business environment for local and international investors."

      "Das DIW Berlin hat in diesem Jahr zum fünften Mal im Auftrag der Deutschen Telekom Stiftung und des Bundesverbandes der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) einen Gesamtindikator für die Innovationsfähigkeit Deutschlands im internationalen Vergleich ermittelt. Dabei wird die Fähigkeit eines Landes, neues Wissen zu schaffen und in neue marktfähige Produkte und Dienstleistungen (Innovationen) umzusetzen, mit einem Indikatorsystem bewertet, das sowohl einen zusammengefassten Gesamtindikator als auch ein detailliertes Stärken-Schwächen-Profil liefert. In einer Gruppe von 17 weltweit führenden Industrieländern landet Deutschland nur auf dem neunten Platz und damit in einem breiten Mittelfeld. Relativ zu seinen wichtigsten Wettbewerbern verliert Deutschland an Boden. An der Spitze stehen die USA, gefolgt von der Schweiz, Schweden, Finnland und Dänemark. Deutschland ist besonders erfolgreich bei der Vernetzung der Innovationsakteure sowie auf den internationalen Märkten der Hochtechnologiebranchen wie Maschinenbau, chemische Industrie, Automobilbau und Medizintechnik. Die größten Schwächen des nationalen Innovationsystems liegen nach wie vor in der Bildung, bei den Finanzierungsbedingungen für Innovationen und Unternehmensgründungen sowie in der Regulierung von Produktmärkten."

      "Recent immigrants in Switzerland are overrepresented at the top of the wage distribution in high and at the bottom in low skill occupations. Basic economic theory thus suggests that immigration has led to a compression of the wage distribution in the former group and to an expansion in the latter. The data confirm this proposition for high skill occupations, but reveal effects close to zero for low skill occupations. While the estimated wage effects are of considerable magnitude at the tails of the wage distribution in high skill occupations, the effects on overall inequality are shown to be negligible."

      "Management of patient records in a hospital is of major importance, for its impact both on the quality of care and on the associated costs. Since this process is circular, the prevention of the building up of bottlenecks is especially important. Thus, the objective of this paper was to analyze whether the Theory of Constraints (TOC) can be useful to the logistics of medical records in hospitals. The paper is based on a case study conducted aboutthe 2007-2011 period in the Medical Records Logistics Service atthe Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena in Seville (Spain). From April 2008, a set of actions in the clinical record logistics system were implemented based on the application of TOC principles. The results obtained show a significant increase in the level of service and employee productivity, as well as a reduction of cost and the number of patients complaints.",

      "In this paper shortest path games are considered. The transportation of a good in a network has costs and benefit too. The problem is to divide the profit of the transportation among the players. Fragnelli et al (2000) introduce the class of shortest path games, which coincides with the class of monotone games. They also give a characterization of the Shapley value on this class of games. In this paper we consider further four characterizations of the Shapley value (Shapley (1953)'s, Young (1985)'s, Chun (1989)'s, and van den Brink (2001)'s axiomatizations), and conclude that all the mentioned axiomatizations are valid for shortest path games. Fragnelli et al (2000)'s axioms are based on the graph behind the problem, in this paper we do not consider graph specific axioms, we take TU axioms only, that is, we consider all shortest path problems and we take the view of an abstract decision maker who focuses rather on the abstract problem than on the concrete situations."

      "1972 erschien das Buch 'Die Grenzen des Wachstums' als Bericht an den Club of Rome. Diese Publikation ist außerordentlich einflussreich geworden. Sie hat das Denken über Wirtschaft und Umwelt mit einem wachstumskritischen Paradigma versorgt, das auch heute noch weit verbreitet ist und als Denkungsart den (welt -)gesellschaftspolitischen Diskurs gegen Wachstum, gegen Marktwirtschaft und letztlich auch gegen Demokratie einstellt. Das alternative Paradigma von einem 'Wachstum der Grenzen' propagiert keine Verzichtsethik, mutet den Menschen also nicht zu, Steigerungen ihres Lebensstandards vermeintlich höheren Zielen zu opfern. Stattdessen setzt diese Denkungsart auf den Problemlösungsmechanismus intensiven Wachstums: auf eine wissensgetriebene Entkopplung von Wohlstandsproduktion und Ressourcenverbrauch mittels Innovation.",
      "In 1972, the book \"The Limits to Growth\" was published as a report to the Club of Rome. This publication has become extraordinarily influential. It has provided public thought about the economy and the environment with a growth-critical paradigm that is still widespread today and, as a mental model, predisposes the political discourse of our (world) society against growth, against the market economy and ultimately also against democracy. The alternative paradigm of a \" Growth of Limits\" does not propagate an ethics of renunciation, so it does not expect people to sacrifice increases in their standard of living in favor of supposedly higher goals. Instead, this menta l model relies on the problem-solving mechanism of intensive growth: on a knowledge-driven decoupling of wealth production and resource consumption through innovation."

      "Fast alle Branchen der deutschen Industrie haben in diesem Jahr kräftig expandiert. Die Produktion im produzierenden Gewerbe ohne Baugewerbe wird im Jahresdurchschnitt um knapp neun Prozent höher sein als 2009. Die schnelle und kräftige Erholung beruht auch darauf, dass Deutschland im vergangenen Jahrzehnt strukturelle Defizite seiner Industrie abgebaut hat, so dass im Wesentlichen \"nur\" eine konjunkturelle Krise zu überwinden war. Außerdem hat die großzügige Regelung der Kurzarbeit während der Wirtschaftskrise dazu beigetragen, dass die Produktion zügig auf die steigende Nachfrage reagieren konnte. Im kommenden Jahr wird sich die Expansion fortsetzen, wenn auch mit geringerem Tempo. Die Industrieproduktion wird ihr Niveau von 2010 um knapp fünf Prozent übertreffen."

      "This article presents causal evidence on the impact of fertility on women’s subjective well-being using quasi-experimental variation due to preferences for a mixed sibling sex composition (having at least one child of each sex). Based on a large sample of women from 35 developing countries, I find that having children increases mothers’ life satisfaction and happiness. I further establish that the positive impact of fertility on subjective well-being can be explained by related increases in mothers’ satisfaction with family life, friendship, and treatment by others."

      "This study assesses the economic and social impacts of foreign direct investment (FDI) in 17 economies in Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE). More precisely, we investigate how different FDI inflows have affected various economic and social indicators, such as GDP growth, labour market outcomes, and poverty and inequality, for the period since the fall of communism until 2020. We pay particular attention to FDI that originates from the EU, as well as FDI from Germany and Austria, in order to evaluate whether their effects are different from the effects of FDI from other places of origin. We also examine whether there are differences in the impacts of different types of FDI - equity capital, reinvested earnings and intra-company debt, as well as of FDI that goes to different sectors of the economy - the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. We find that FDI inflows have had, in general, a positive effect on economic growth in CESEE, and that this effect has been particularly strong for German and Austrian FDI. For total FDI, higher inflows of 1 percentage point (pp) of GDP are associated with 0.19 pp higher GDP growth. For FDI from Germany and Austria, this effect is five times higher - FDI inflows of 1 pp of GDP have led to 0.9 pp higher GDP growth. The positive GDP effects have come from the higher consumption and exports that the FDI has induced. FDI inflows have also reduced unemployment and increased wages, but have had no effects on labour productivity. Total FDI has had only limited effects on inequality and poverty, but FDI from Germany and Austria has been found to reduce both inequality and poverty, likely because they have benefitted mainly lower-income persons. There are differences in the effects of the different types of FDI, with reinvested earnings and equity capital having in general more beneficial effects than intra-company loans. Also, FDI in different sectors of the economy has had different effects, with inflows to the secondary and tertiary sectors having greater effects than inflows to the primary sector. The policy implications of these results are that CESEE economies should not give up on their efforts to attract more FDI, but also that their endeavours should be more targeted, focusing on investments that have greater economic and social impacts. Moreover, foreign investment should not be criticised for the perhaps unsatisfactory economic and social performances of the economies from this region. Instead, the reasons for this should be sought in domestic factors and in the modest growth of the European Union during the past two decades."

      "Purpose - The present study aimed to examine the relationship between information and communication technologies (ICT) diffusion, financial development and economic growth in the panel of developing countries for 2005-2019. Design/methodology/approach - The study employed the principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the index of ICT diffusion. First-generation panel unit root tests such as Levine Lin Chu (LLC), Im Pesaran Shin (IPS), Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips and Perron (PP) were employed to check the stationarity of the variables. Pedroni and Kao co-integration techniques were used to examine the existence of the long-run relationship, and co-integration coefficients were estimated using FMOLS and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS). The panel Granger causality approach examined the short-run and long-run causality. Findings - The results confirmed that ICT diffusion, financial development and trade openness accelerate growth, whereas inflation dampens economic growth. Further, the causality test showed bidirectional causality between ICT growth and financial development growth but a unidirectional causality from financial development to ICT diffusion in developing countries. Originality/value - The study recommends synchronizing public and private sector investment for a synergistic effect on ICT infrastructure and adequate investment in the financial sector to increase the growth rate in developing countries. Economic policies should be adopted toward incentives and subsidies to ensure affordable ICT services for disadvantaged communities. Also, training programs focussing on enhancing digital literacy to enable all segments of the population to use digital platforms for financial services are recommended."

      "Economic disparities between the regions of the European Union are of constant concern both for policy and economic research. One of the “stylised facts” from the empirical literature is that the process of absolute convergence observed for decades has slowed down or even petered out during the 1980s. In this paper we analyse whether it has resumed and persisted in the 1990s when European integration made huge steps forward. We construct a typology of regions in order to examine whether there are overlapping trends of regional development, in particular, overall convergence on the one hand and persistent or even increasing spatial concentration (agglomeration) on the other. Both of our approaches, Marcov chain analysis and dynamic panel estimation, provide evidence that regional convergence in the EU15 has become stronger in the 1990s. At the same time there appears to exist a tendency towards further agglomeration of high income economic activities. Keywords: Regional growth, agglomeration, dynamic panel estimation"

Using China and the USA as control groups it is found that the Fukushima trade cost shock reduced the average number of import transactions per year at the firm-good level and, therefore, increased the degree of lumpiness of imports from Japan."

      "This study analyzes the stability of the distance coefficient values over time in the generalized gravity equation of Bergstrand (1989) using both aggregate and disaggregated trade flows among 22 OECD countries recorded for the sample period covering 1970 until 2000. We estimate the gravity equation both in its traditional form as well as by taking into account multilateral resistance as suggested in Baier and Bergstrand (2007). First of all, we find that the missing globalization puzzle, typically observed in empirical gravity models for aggregate trade flows, largely disappears when one estimates a gravity model using disaggregated trade data at the level of individual industries. Secondly, we document that accounting for multilateral price resistance alone can provide some evidence against the missing globalization puzzle. At the same time, the results obtained for a traditional specification of the gravity equation emphasizing the importance of disaggregated trade flows in explaining the distance puzzle remain largely intact. We also illustrate how the aggregation bias could have contributed to a typical finding of a non-declining trade-deterring role of distance in the existing literature."

      "This paper provides an analysis of the convergence pattern of German housing prices and rents employing a new dataset that covers all the country's administrative districts. In addition to conventional tests for β-convergence and δ-convergence, we apply Phillips and Sul's (2007) approach so as to allow for the various heterogeneity and transitional dynamics across districts. Our results reveal no evidence of convergence across Germany or within states; rather, we discover widespread evidence of divergence, as well as evidence of inter-state convergence and support for the existence of convergence clubs. At the federal level, we identify club numbers ranging from 11 (for existing flat prices) to 5 (for new flat rents). At the state level, the estimated number of clubs is generally lower, ranging from 0 to 6."

      "Rapid urbanization has resulted in sudden degradation of the environmental quality of urban settlements, which are difficult to measure and quantify. The present study attempts to provide an assessment of the environmental quality by developing environmental quality index (EQI) for the Ernakulam district in Kerala, India. The index values are spatially mapped to develop an environmental quality index map for the study area under five different classes namely, very poor, poor, moderate, good, very good. The EQI values are calculated for nineteen composite variables classified under three domains namely, ecological, meteorological, and socio-economic domains. A preliminary statistical analysis and detailed principal component analysis (PCA) were performed to construct the environmental quality index for the study region. This was followed by a spatial mapping and analysis to provide a better understanding of the status of the environmental quality to the local residents, environmental planners, regional scientists and policymakers. The results obtained from the analysis show that the study area has a low overall environmental quality. The region considered in this paper has highlighting features of various settlement patterns, population distributions, and land use distributions, which indicates a clear transition in the environmental quality index of different settlement units. Hence, by selecting this region and observing various number of indicators, the real effect of urbanization on the quality of the environment was projected. The systematic methodological procedure explained in this paper can be used elsewhere also, where the study area has similar characteristics as that of the area considered in this study. The outcome of the study is applicable for present and future urban planning, building construction, land and resource management for a sustainable environment."

      "Internationalisation has been a key strategy for businesses around the world over the last decades. Nowadays, the European wine sector finds itself in an increasingly competitive international environment, which is characterised by mature and declining per capita wine consumption in traditional markets and increasing competition form new emerging wine producing countries. Structurally, this sector is characterised by a vast majority of family businesses and faces several particularities. This research investigates the perception of difficulties in the internationalisation process of small and medium wineries in two emerging Italian wine exporting regions. It is found that the difficulties perceived in the internationalisation process depend on strategic and structural factors. The strategic factors highlighted in this paper are the degree of international diversification and the geographic scope of a firm's export activities. The structural factors relate to the characteristics of the exported goods, the management and the size of a firm. The findings are discussed in the light of recent developments of Italian wine exports and their implications for the Italian wine sector are derived."

      "We perform an experiment where subjects pay for the right to participate in a shareholder vote. We find that experimental subjects are willing to pay a significant premium for the voting right even though there should be no such premium in our setup under full rationality. Private benefits from controlling the firm are absent from our setup and overconfidence cannot explain the size of the observed voting premium. The premium disappears in treatments where voting has no material consequences for the subjects. We conclude that individuals enjoy being part of a group that exercises power and are therefore willing to pay for the right to vote even when the impact of their own vote on their payoffs is negligible."

For the new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe, the results of our model show that the majority of crises in those countries can be explained by inconsistencies in the domestic policy mix and by the deterioration of macroeconomic fundamentals, as emphasized by first generation crises models, while for the CIS countries analysed, financial vulnerability type indicators were the most relevant, i.e., indicators connected with the second and third generation of crisis model better explain the vulnerability of these countries. Additionally, the set of indicators choosen by our model is rather heterogenous, supporting the superiority of a country-by-country approach."

      "A rich recent literature reinvestigates the nature of money, but little attention has been paid to the ramifications of the ways in which we theorize money for the theory of international trade. This paper examines the logical relationship between the neutrality of money and self-balancing trade based on Henry Thornton and David Ricardo as two foundational contributions to credit and commodity money theories respectively. I show that both authors theorize trade as self-balancing whenever money is conceptualized as neutral. I distinguish two notions of the neutrality of money: ex ante and ex post neutrality. In Thornton's Paper Credit money is not neutral ex ante: there can be temporary trade imbalances. But in the long-run money is neutral ex post and international trade boils down to self-balancing barter. In Ricardo money is neutral both ex ante and ex post and international trade is always balanced unless central bank policy undermines monetary neutrality."

      "This study examines the impact of publicly provided daycare for children aged 0-3 on outcomes of children and their caregivers over the course of seven years after enrollment into daycare. At the end of 2007, the city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil used a lottery to assign children to limited public daycare openings. Winning the lottery translated to a 34 percent increase in time in daycare during a child's first four years of life. This allowed caregivers more time to work, resulting in higher incomes for beneciary households in the first year of daycare attendance and 4 years later (but not after 7 years, by which time all children were eligible for universal schooling). The rise in labor force participation is driven primarily by grandparents and by adolescent siblings residing in the same household as (and possibly caring for) the child, and not by parents, most of whom were already working. Beneciary children saw sustained gains in height-for-age and weight-for-age, due to better nutritional intake at school and at home. Gains in beneciary children's cognitive development were observed 4 years after enrolment but not later."

      "We analyze a monopolist who offers different variants of a possibly dangerous product to heterogeneous customers. Product variants are distinguished by different safety attributes. Customers choose product usage which co- determines expected harm. We find that, even with customers being perfectly informed about product variants' safety, product liability can further welfare by limiting the firm's incentives to distort product safety in pursuance of profit- maximizing price discrimination. In this context, strict liability has to be accompanied by a defense of product misuse, but reasonable use of the base product variant should be defined more leniently than what an application of the Hand rule or instructions in user manuals might prescribe."

      "Background: Worktime is one of the main drivers of life satisfaction, and a balanced distribution of working hours and leisure hours directly impacts feelings of well-being. Based on previous studies, we seek to confrm this relationship in the European context and explore other potential driving forces of life satisfaction. Health condition as the mediating variable is also examined. Methods: This article uses an ordered probit model to analyze the impact of working time on life satisfaction using data extracted from the most recent round (wave 10) of the European Social Survey (ESS). Hypotheses are proposed to test the impact of working time on life satisfaction, the mediating efect of health in the worktime-satisfaction nexus, and the efects of social inclusion, social trust, feelings of safety, and digitalization on life satisfaction. Results: The results reveal a negative and signifcant correlation between hours of work and life satisfaction, thus implying that a shorter working week can improve Europeans' life satisfaction. Health is found to be an important intermediate variable that plays an essential role in the dynamic through which working times infuence life satisfaction. Further, we fnd that those in the middle class prefer to work shorter hours to achieve a higher feeling of satisfaction and that high earners to a lesser extent, while low earners generally show no preference. Employees of private frms are more satisfed with shorter working hours, while satisfaction for those working in public institutions is not afected by changes in hours worked. Finally, we verify the robustness of our estimations by replacing life satisfaction with happiness. Conclusions: Working fewer hours contributes to higher life satisfaction in Europe, and health plays an essential mediating role in this relationship. Social inclusion, social trust, feelings of safety and digitalization all play a factor in improving life satisfaction. Compared to other job categories, private sector employees can achieve greater life satisfaction from reducing their total working time."

      "Using micro data on more than 130,000 individuals from 69 countries, we analyze the extent to which joblessness of the individuals and the prevailing unemployment rate in the country impact perceptions of the effectiveness of democracy. We find that personal joblessness experience translates into negative opinions about the effectiveness of democracy, and it increases the desire for a rouge leader. Evidence from people who live in European countries suggests that being jobless for more than a year is the main source of the impact. Joblessness-related negative attitude towards the effectiveness of democracy is not because of a general displeasure towards the government, but rather, it is targeted towards democracy. We also find that well-educated and wealthier individuals are less likely to indicate that democracies are ineffective. The beliefs about the effectiveness of democracy as system of governance are also shaped by the unemployment rate in countries with low levels of democracy. The results suggest that periods of high unemployment and joblessness would hinder the development of democracy."

      "The global low-carbon energy transition will require major changes to institutional practices and energy industry paradigms with implications for society writ large. A country's existing institutional pattern inevitably shapes the transition, and helps or hinders its progress. This is perhaps especially so in state-dominated systems such as China, which have historically considered energy as a strategic field for reasons of both security and economic development. China has already taken steps to embrace clean energy, even as it remains the world's largest consumer of fossil fuels: Indeed, it is the world's leading producer and consumer of renewable energy in absolute terms today, and the country's leaders speak of encouraging a revolution in energy consumption and production, in line with new targets announced in 2020 to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. But how successful will China be in introducing the sweeping changes required? At the technological level, such changes could include replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, but they also require institutional shifts, which could entail major market reforms and changes to the structure of the Chinese energy sector, dominated now by SOEs and administrative planning. This paper examines how China's institutional setting both contributes to and hinders the energy transition, with a particular emphasis on the energy sector. It also aims to dispel the binary view of China's governance and the energy transition, in which central government commitment is portrayed as the sole determinant of success. Finally, it sets out a preliminary framework for analysing the areas where technological and institutional factors make change more likely to be lasting and transformative, versus areas in which resistance will likely remain strong. Historically, China has been better at building out energy supplies and adding the 'hardware' of energy infrastructure, while having greater difficulty adjusting the 'software' of institutional and societal change or practices related to energy demand and energy efficiency. We would argue that China is likely to continue to expand the hardware, given its strong institutions devoted to investing in supply. But China will struggle with the software as this relies on a demand pull, market incentives, and greater coordination among stakeholders and between sectors. When considering innovation for the energy transition, the paper makes a similar argument: China's technology innovation system has enabled innovation in first generation technologies. But will China's strong incumbent industries impede the transformational change required for the more modular technologies that are less capital intensive and require greater societal involvement and coordination? China has come to dominate global supplies in manufacturing-intensive technologies - solar photovoltaics and batteries - which have also seen the most rapid cost declines due to scale. For design-intensive technology - such as wind, concentrating solar power plants, or advanced coal plants - cost declines have not been as pronounced. For those technologies that are less modular and more design-intensive, state-owned enterprises may play a larger role and the potential for transformative technological change could be slower to emerge."

      "This paper reports an experiment examining the effect of social norms on pro-social behavior. We test two predictions derived from work in psychology regarding the influence of norms. The first is a focusing influence, whereby norms only impact behavior when an individual's attention is drawn to them; and the second is an informational influence, whereby a norm exerts a stronger impact on an individual the more others he observes behaving consistently with that norm. We find support for both effects. Either thinking about or observing the behavior of others produces increased pro-social behavior even when one expects or observes little pro-social behavior on the part of others and the degree of pro-social behavior is increasing in the actual and expected pro-social behavior of others. This experiment eliminates strategic influences and thus demonstrates a direct effect of norms on behavior."

      "The study discusses the aspirations and preferences of youth in rural sub-Saharan Africa using a large-scale SMS-based survey data and complements it with an investigation on the causal effects of adolescent aspirations on migration decisions when youth in southwestern Ethiopia. The cross-country youth study shows that most rural youth in Africa prefer working in nonfarm economic sectors. It also finds that above half of the rural youth are undecided about their migration aspirations, providing an opportunity for governments to influence the rural out migration of youth. However, policymakers should also be equally aware that anti-poverty policy measures that simply improve the incomes of rural youth might have unpredictable and unintended consequences on their migration decisions. As a result, policy measures may have to also influence the perceptions of youth toward farming and rural life, and to make rural areas more attractive to the youth. Taking southwestern Ethiopia as a case in point, it was found that above half the adolescents have negative perceptions about farming (both farming life and the pre-requisites to become a farmer). The results also show that educational and occupational aspirations during adolescence exert differing effects on migration decisions after four years. That is, while those who aspired to attain more years of schooling are unlikely to out-migrate within this time period, their counterparts who aspired to have high socio-economic status occupations tend to out-migrate from the respective areas. The study concludes that the out-migration of youth from rural areas and small towns may not be only due to push factors such as lack of farmland, but it could also be due to their aspirations to work in high socio-economic status occupations which are not often found in the rural areas. Thus, African countries should work to make rural areas and farming more attractive to the aspiring youth such as through improving access to technology, developing infrastructure, and providing support to rural non-farm sectors expansion."

      "We assess the behavior of real effective exchange rates (REERs) of members of the CEMAC zone with respect to their long-term equilibrium paths. A reduced form of the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER) model is estimated and associated misalignments are derived for the period 1980 to 2009. Our findings suggest that for majority of countries, macroeconomic fundamentals have the expected associations with the exchange rate fluctuations. The analysis also reveals that, only the REER adjustments of Cameroon and Gabon are significant in restoring the long-term equilibrium in event of a shock. The Cameroonian economic fundamentals of terms of trade, government expenditure and openness have different long-term relations with the REER in comparison to those of other member states. Ultimately, there is no need for an adjustment in the level of the peg based on the present quantitative analysis of REER paths."

      "Although hybrid entrepreneurship constitutes a significant share of entrepreneurial activity, research on this topic is still in its infancy. Moreover, in general entrepreneurship research only few studies have investigated intra-couple influences on the decision to be and to become self-employed. Therefore, in the study at hand, we use panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) to analyse whether life partners and their occupational choice relate to wage workers' propensity to enter full-time entrepreneurship either directly or indirectly via hybrid entrepreneurship. Drawing on social capital theory, this study also tests whether the results are different for men and women. Although hypothesised, we find no empirical evidence for the relevance of life partners and their occupations on direct transition to full-time entrepreneurship. For women, however, our findings do suggest that having a self-employed life partner significantly increases their propensity to enter entrepreneurship indirectly, that is, via hybrid entrepreneurship."

      "How globalisation influences social expenditure has been examined for industrialized countries. Globalisation has often been shown to be positively associated with social expenditure in established industrialized countries, a finding that corroborates the compensation hypothesis. Scholars have focused on industrialised countries, because social expenditure is difficult to measure in developing countries. I use new data on social expenditure for Asian non-OECD countries. Globalisation is measured by the new KOF Globalisation Index. My results do not suggest that globalisation influenced social expenditures in Asia. Neither do the results suggest that the nexus between globalisation and social expenditures varied across high-income countries, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, and lower-income Asian countries or across Asian regions. It is conceivable that Asian citizens did not demand increasing social support when globalisation proceeded rapidly because they enjoyed family and other private assistance. Asian countries also have weaker tax and labour market institutions than OECD countries and have therefore more difficulties in increasing social expenditure."

      "Fixed Capital has a major role in economic growth literature and on the estimation of potential output using a production function - which is essential to design macroeconomic policy. One of the main contributions of this work, differently from the previous works, is to estimate the capital stock from a disaggregated perspective using Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) by product level throughout a detailed and historical treatment of the data from System of National Accounts (SNA). This methodology avoids distortions arise from changes in relative prices and changes in capital composition, capturing the real GFCF flows with precision and leading to better estimation of depreciation and net investment. In order to obtain a consistent and disaggregated time series of GFCF, it was necessary to adapt information from different methodologies obtained in the Supply and Uses Tables and in the Input-Output Tables (IO), as well as to use depreciation rates and life cycle in terms of products. At the end, annual estimates of the following variables were obtained for the period from 1947 to 2017: net fixed capital stock, net investment, investment rate, depreciation rate and capital/output ratio. Another contribution of this paper is the estimation of series with higher frequencies (quarterly and monthly), with data updated until 2019 and compatible with the SNA expanding the scope of application of the estimated series for short-run analysis."

      "Do capitalists really want a recovery? Can they afford it? On the face of it, the question sounds silly: of course capitalists want a recovery; how else can they prosper? According to the textbooks, both mainstream and heterodox, capital accumulation and economic growth are two sides of the same process. Accumulation generates growth and growth fuels accumulation, so it seems bootless to ask whether capitalists want growth. Growth is their lifeline, and the more of it, the better it is. Or is it? In the United States, rising unemployment – which hammers the well-being of workers, unincorporated businesses and the unemployed – serves not to undermine but to boost the overall income share of capitalists. And as employment growth decelerates, the income share of the Top 1% – which includes the capitalists as well as their protective power belt – soars. Under these circumstances, what reason do capitalists have to ‘get the economy going’? Why worry about rising unemployment and zero job growth when these very processes serve to boost their income-share-read-power?"

      "In the past 10 years, the service sector has been a significant contributor to overall economic growth in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam. Sector growth has been supported by strong industrial growth in some while in others the critical factors have been liberalization, structural reforms, government support, and foreign investments. In order to increase the labor productivity of the sector and realize its potential to contribute to inclusive growth, these countries must address gaps in human capital and the higher costs of setting up new businesses and of doing business that stifle entrepreneurship and private enterprise. These impediments also stand in the way of developing the industry sector and of broader economic growth and development. Policy reforms that ease those impediments will help to achieve balanced growth in which the service and industry sectors support and reinforce each other. As services tend to be more labor intensive, they can foster inclusive growth by serving as an engine for creating jobs."

      "What are the drivers of business cycle fluctuations? And how many are there? By documenting strong and predictable co-movement of real variables during the business cycle in a sample of advanced economies, we argue that most business cycle fluctuations a re d riven b y o ne major factor. The positive co-movement of real output and inflation convincingly argues for a demand story. This feature - robust across time and space - provides a simple smell test for structural macroeconomic models. We propose a simple statistic that can compare data and models. Based on this statistic, we show that the recent vintage of structural economic models has difficulties replicating the stylized facts we document."

      "El presente trabajo tiene por objeto demostrar la existencia de la Tasa de Depreciación del Capital Humano en Argentina, haciendo uso de un modelo sencillo que permita incorporar la obsolescencia de sus dos principales fuentes de acumulación, escolaridad y experiencia. Usando los datos provistos por la EPH elaborada por INDEC para el IV trimestre de 2011, se pudo obtener los resultados que prueban dicha hipótesis, evidenciando además que la misma no es constante. Al permitir la identificación de las fuentes de acumulación de Capital Humano, también puede diferenciarse las tasas de depreciación de cada una de ellas y su efecto sobre la depreciación de dicho capital como un todo. Así mismo se identifican diferencias en las tasas de depreciación para diferentes rangos de edades, e incluso para diferentes sectores industriales, incorporando el concepto de depreciación externa al de depreciación interna."

      "This paper analyses the effect of emigration from Poland around the time of EU accession on the Polish labour market. We develop a simple model that guides our empirical specification and provides a clear interpretation for our estimates. Focussing on the 1998-2007 period for Poland, we use a unique data set that contains information about household members who are currently living abroad, which allows us to develop region-specific emigration rates and estimate emigration's effect on wages using within-region variation. Our results show that emigration from Poland was largest for workers with intermediate-level skills and that it is wages for this skill group that increased most. We also show that emigration led to a slight increase in wages overall but that workers at the low end of the skill distribution made no gains and may actually have experienced slight wage decreases."

      "Loan defaults continue to be a major challenge that confronts financial institutions in developing countries and this impedes their potential role in sustainable development. Given the enormity of loan defaults, policymakers have devoted much attention to the phenomenon by implementing strategies and policies aimed at improving loan repayment to avert the situation. To complement the effort of policymakers, several empirical studies have also been conducted regarding loan repayment determinants; but what is worrying is that none of these studies emphasises the role of financial literacy, especially in the Ghanaian context. This study therefore examines the potential effect of financial literacy on loan repayment. We rely on primary data and employ the binary probit regression for the analysis. The results reveal a positive and significant relationship between financial literacy and loan repayment. This means that enhancing financial literacy improves loan repayment significantly which will in turn ensure sustainability of the financial institutions. The level of education of borrowers is also revealed to play a key role in loan repayment. Given the findings, the study sheds new lights on how loan repayment can be improved to ensure a vibrant banking sector."

      "There is a large body of literature on the relationship between innovations and employment at the firm level, with most of the results indicating positive effects. Thus far, this kind of analysis has not been performed for Poland and it seems to be an important and interesting field for research. On the other hand, there is some empirical evidence that developments in the Polish labour market are at least partially driven by the Skill Biased Technical Change (SBTC) process. This paper tries to fill in this gap by looking at three dimensions of the relationship between innovations and employment in Poland: innovations and job creation, innovations and the skill structure of employment innovations, and wage formation. The results of the analysis indicate that there is a weak but positive relationship between the level of innovations and the probability of job creation. However, we have not been able to prove that innovations have any effect on the skill structure of labour demand in Poland. We have however found a positive and statistically significant relationship between the level of innovations and skill-biased wage changes. The results indicate that innovations positively influence the wages of skilled workers while they negatively influence the wages of the unskilled."

      "This paper presents the major characteristics of the Brazilian tax system, after underlining the modifications it went through since 1988, when the country adopted a new and democratic Constitution. One important feature is the marked incidence of indirect consumer and production taxes (49% of all tax revenues) in place of direct taxes on income, inheritance, and capital gains. This imbalance between indirect and direct taxes explains, in large part, the elevated regressivity of the Brazilian tax system, which both expresses and reproduces the profound inequalities that characterize Brazilian society."

      "This paper examines how time to build alters strategic investment behaviour under oligopoly. Facing demand uncertainty, firms decide whether to invest early or wait until uncertainty has been resolved. A game that captures time-to-build investment is contrasted with another one in which investment is quick in place. We show that a time lag between when and how much to invest reduces the incentive to delay. When investment requires time to complete, early investment occurs more to avoid becoming a follower than to become a strategic investment leader. The opposite is true with quick-in-place investment. A brief welfare analysis is provided."

      "This paper substantiates the debate following Richard Florida's suggestion to measure regional human capital by creative occupations rather than education. Consistent with Florida's notion of creativity, it suggests a microfoundation that relates creativity to workers' cognitive and noncognitive skills. It shows that this microfoundation is similar to that of human capital in recent labor economics, which has facilitated important new insights. It also shows that Florida's measure is too crude to make a difference. Nonethe-less, it is time to rethink regional human capital. Occupations may help project workers' cognitive and noncognitive skills from the micro to the regional level."

The one-off large state intervention had consequences in several dimensions: on the one hand, it had a positive impact on the system's short-term economic, social and political stability by dynamizing different economic sub-spheres. State intervention, at the same time, temporary slowed down the process of economic transformation and also mobilized system characteristics that lead to overheating and to renewed state intervention to cool it down. This paper sheds light on the consequences of adaptation to external and internal pressures on national, sectoral, regional, and structural dimensions from a systemic point of view."

      "In this paper, I investigate how inflation signals from different types of newspapers influence household inflation expectations in Germany. Using text data and the large language model GPT-3.5-turbo-1106, I construct newspaper-specific indicators and find significant heterogeneity in their informativeness based on the genre-tabloid versus reputable sources. The tabloid's indicator is more effective for predicting perceived inflation among low-income and lower-education households, while reputable newspapers better predict higher-income and more educated households' expectations. Local projections reveal that tabloid sentiment shows an immediate decrease following a monetary policy shock, whereas responses from reputable newspapers are smaller and delayed. Household expectations also vary depending on the type of newspaper affected by the sentiment shock and the socioeconomic background of the household. These findings underscore the differentiated impact of media on inflation expectations across various segments of society, providing valuable insights for policymakers to tailor communication strategies effectively."

      "This article analyses value changes of German stock market companies in response to movements of the US dollar. The approach followed in this work extends the standard means of measuring exchange rate exposure in several ways (e.g. by using multi-factor modelling instead of augmented CAPM, application of moving window panel regressions, orthogonalization of overall market risk vis-à-vis currency risk). The main innovation lies in testing implications of exchange rate adjustment costs (hedging costs) for firm values and exposure. Based on time series data of German DAX companies, DM/ dollar rates and macroeconomic factors, we find a rather unstable, time-variant exposure of German stock market companies. Dollar sensitivity is positively affected by the ratio of exports/GDP and negatively affected by imports/GDP as well as by significant deviations of the dollar price from its long-run median. The first two findings are in line with the presumption that exporting corporations benefit from dollar price increases, whereas importing corporations benefit from dollar price decreases. The last finding can be explained by higher exchange rate adjustment costs in case of substantial deviations from the long-run median level. Furthermore, there is indication of asymmetric adjustment costs as effects from appreciations of domestic currency appear to be smaller than from depreciations."

      "The People's Republic of China (PRC) has emerged as a major player in the global economy and considers free trade agreements (FTAs) an important part of its global trading strategy. The PRC's export industries are embedded in existing regional and global production networks and are reliant on foreign direct investment flows and external supplies of material and intermediate goods. Immediately after its accession to the World Trade Organization in December 2001, the PRC adopted a regional approach to trade and began negotiating and implementing FTAs. This paper analyzes the results of a survey undertaken across 232 Chinese firms with regard to FTA-related issues such as utilization, perceived costs and benefits, perceptions of multiple rules of origin, and policy and institutional support mechanisms. It was found that, of the firms surveyed, 45% were using FTAs to some extent. While this utilization rate appears relatively high, and reflects the assertive stance of Chinese firms when it comes to exploring market opportunities, the actual coverage of export value by FTAs is variable. In general, Chinese firms view FTAs as a way to increase their access to partner markets. Nevertheless, there remains an orientation toward the United States and other traditional markets. However, over time, as rebalancing of growth takes place, there may be a shift in market orientation toward the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and regional markets and the use of FTAs may intensify. This study offers several proposals to increase FTA use, including the expansion of support services for firms, the promotion of larger regional FTAs, and the creation of more opportunities for collaboration between the government and the private sector."

      "In 2015, the share of women in the top decision-making bodies of the financial sector increased once again but men remain in the overwhelming majority and thus continue to call the shots. At the end of 2015, women made up just under eight percent of executive board members of the 100 largest banks in Germany. The corresponding figure for the 59 largest insurance companies was a good nine percent. In both cases, this is less than a percentage point more than in 2014. Even on supervisory boards where the share of women is traditionally higher, both banks (with just over 21 percent women on supervisory boards) and insurance companies (with just over 19 percent) have a long way to go before achieving gender parity. The proportion of women on the supervisory boards of cooperative banks was particularly low (under 16 percent) despite the fact that these institutions are, in principle, based on a participatory business model. Overall, many more women than men are employed in the financial sector. As is generally known, the presence of women in senior management in particular is a prerequisite for their promotion to top management bodies. The companies would therefore be well advised to improve the career opportunities of their most talented female employees by promoting them more frequently and appointing them to managerial positions. This would be a wise move in anticipation of a possible expansion of the statutory gender quota and a tightening of the sanctions set out in the new law on equality for women and men in managerial positions, both in the private and public sectors, which was enacted in Germany in May 2015."

      "Nachdem sich die zentralen Prozesse zur Entwicklung neuer Produkte in den vergangenen Jahren in Richtung der Integration von Unternehmensexternen in den ursprünglich internen Innovationsprozess verschoben haben, sind diverse Begriffe wie die kollaborative Produktentwicklung, die Integration des Kundenwissens, Co-Design, Open Innovation und Crowdsourcing in den Fokus gerückt. Besonders das auf dem Grundsatz der \"Weisheit der Masse\" basierende Prinzip des Crowdsourcing wird dabei als wegweisendes Tool im Innovationsmanagement angesehen. Es bedarf demnach einer Evaluation der Erfolgsaussichten der Öffnung des internen Prozesses gegenüber der externen Umwelt im Zuge des Crowdsourcing und der damit verbundenen Herausforderungen. Dabei wird auch die Frage adressiert, inwiefern dieses - bisher üblicherweise in Massenmärkten Anwendung findende - Prinzip theoretisch auch für andere Märkte von Relevanz ist, bspw. den Luxusmarkt. Die Erkenntnis über das Potenzial des Crowdsourcing für die Unternehmenspraxis wird in diesem Beitrag ebenso vermittelt wie Handlungsempfehlungen für Innovationsmanager.",
      "As the central processes regarding the new product development have within the last years shifted towards the integration of external units into the originally internal innovation process, diverse concepts have come to the fore, e.g. the collaborative product development, the integration of the customers' knowledge, Co-Design, Open Innovation and Crowdsourcing. In this connection, especially Crowdsourcing which is based on the principle of the 'wisdom of crowds' is regarded as seminal innovation management tool. Hence, the evaluation of the prospects of success regarding the opening of the internal process towards the external environment in the course of Crowdsourcing as well as the herewith connected challenges is required. Within the investigation, the question is addressed whether this - typically in mass markets applied - principle is also of relevance for other markets, for instance the luxury market. The insight on the potential of Crowdsourcing for the organizational practice is conveyed within this article, and recommendations for innovation managers will be given."

      "We present the results of a randomized intervention in schools to study how teaching financial literacy affects risk and time preferences of adolescents. Following ore than 600 adolescents, aged 16 years on average, over about half a year, we provide causal evidence that teaching financial literacy has significant short-term and longer-term effects on risk and time preferences. Compared to two different control treatments, we find that teaching financial literacy makes subjects more patient, less present-biased, and slightly more risk-averse. Our finding that the intervention changes economic preferences contributes to a better understanding of why financial literacy has been shown to correlate systematically with financial behavior in previous studies. We argue that the link between financial literacy and field behavior works through economic preferences. In our study, the latter are also related in a meaningful way to students' field behavior."

      "While the regional economic integration encompassing the former Soviet Union (FSU) transpires to be inefficient, there appears to be a stronger interest in regionalism in smaller groups of more homogenous and geographically connected countries of the region, specifically, Central Asia. Using a new dataset, we find that although the economic links between the Central Asian countries are more pronounced than between that of the CIS in several key areas, this advantage has been disappearing fast over the last decade. In addition, the trend of economic integration of Central Asia strongly correlates to that of the CIS in general. Currently Central Asia should be treated as a sub-region of the post-Soviet world rather than a definite integration region.On the other hand, however, we find that Kazakhstan emerges as a new centre for regional integration, which can bear some potential for regionalism in Central Asia, and that there is an increasing trend towards greater economic interconnections with China in Central Asia."

      "The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of the interbank market on the business cycle fluctuations. In order to do that, we build a DSGE model with heterogeneous households and banks. The surplus bank can allocate its resources between interbank lending and risk free government bonds. This portfolio choice is affected by an exogenous counterpart risk shock on the interbank lending. An increase of the counterpart risk diverts funds from the interbank markets toward the risk free market. This mechanism allow us to capture the collapse of the interbank market and the fly to quality mechanism underlying the 2007 financial crisis. The main result is that an interbank riskiness shock seems to explain part of the 2007 downturn and especially the rise of the interest rates on the credit market during and just after the financial turmoil."

      "Team start-ups have substantial advantages over solo start-ups, but teams often do not live up to their potential due to conflicts creating unfavorable team dynamics. Based on an experiment with 665 individuals in 133 randomly composed teams participating in a new-venture simulation, we found team members’ deep-level characteristics that trigger motivations to act, i.e., achievement motivation and leadership orientations, to be particularly important sources of task conflicts. We found that diversity in leadership orientation reduces conflicts because not all team members can lead at the same time. Unlike hypothesized, we found that diversity in achievement motivation also reduces conflicts, for which, ex-post, we explore potential reasons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mediating task and relationship conflicts differently affect team outcomes due to their different nature of task-relatedness: while task conflicts affect task-related team efficacy and may escalate into relationship conflicts, relationship conflicts directly affect team satisfaction, but not team efficacy. Further emphasizing the importance of a motivational basis of conflicts, we found that individuals’ general self-efficacy, a more belief-related construct, affects team outcomes only through team efficacy, but not via conflicts."

      "Before we can reform the financial system, we need to understand what banks do; or, better, what banks should do. This paper will examine the later work of Hyman Minsky at the Levy Institute, on his project titled 'Reconstituting the United States' Financial Structure.' This led to a number of Levy working papers and also to a draft book manuscript that was left uncompleted at his death in 1996. In this paper I focus on Minsky's papers and manuscripts from 1992 to 1996 and his last major contribution (his Veblen-Commons Award-winning paper). Much of this work was devoted to his thoughts on the role that banks do and should play in the economy. To put it as succinctly as possible, Minsky always insisted that the proper role of the financial system was to promote the 'capital development' of the economy. By this he did not simply mean that banks should finance investment in physical capital. Rather, he was concerned with creating a financial structure that would be conducive to economic development to improve living standards, broadly defined. Central to his argument is the understanding of banking that he developed over his career. Just as the financial system changed (and with it, the capitalist economy), Minsky's views evolved. I will conclude with general recommendations for reform along Minskyan lines."

      "This article aims to explain the idea of X-efficiency, which indicates the difference between potential and actual output. If any business subject produces below its own potentials, it can be considered X-inefficient. To determine whether X-inefficiency in Croatian companies exists, how large it is in its volume and why it appears, in 2014, empirical research was conducted. Since only 22% of interviewed companies use all their available resources and given that the mean capacity utilization rate is only 70% and the mean resource utilization rate is 68%, our study results suggest that among business subjects in the Republic of Croatia, X-inefficiency exists to a large extent. Qualitative analysis shows that X-inefficiency appears mostly because of the competitive pressure. Other reasons include legal and administrative problems, the existence of inertness and a lack of motivation, the decision to work 'less for more', inadequate demand, economic crisis, the decision to save resources for future use, seasonal demand, incompetence of the government, corruption, and the risk of debt collection as well as local organizational problems."

      "Immigration continues to be on the forefront of the policy debate on both sides of the Atlantic. A number of reforms of permanent and guest-worker (GW) immigration programs are being considered, and the temporary movement of service providers under Mode IV (GATS) is being negotiated at the Doha Round of the WTO. This paper contributes to the debate by examining these programs in a model where the host country government maximizes its objective function with respect to three policy instruments: the share of migrants' deferred income payment, the value of the bond employers must post and forfeit if GWs overstay, and the size of the program. Circular migration and illegal GWs' status regularization are considered. The paper shows that i) the optimal value of the bond is zero, ii) Mode IV is preferable to GW migration; iii) the optimal policy package consists of Mode IV and permanent migration, and iv) incorporating circular migration improves the policy package. Additional policy implications are also provided."

They find that much of the apparent shift in export product shares was a result of the worldwide collapse in demand for high-technology products, particularly new aircraft and information technology products. Nonetheless, India, ASEAN-10, and the newly industrialized economies are destinations for US high-technology products to an even greater extent than for the world as a whole. In contrast, the People's Republic of China tends to import a lower portion of high-technology products but a larger share of agriculture-related and raw materials and energy products than the world as a whole.\""

      "Traditional labour supply theories stress economic variables as unemployment and wages to explain differences inlabour supply behaviour. Nowadays a number of trends can be observed in the literature about labour supply theoryand modelling: the integration of market-based and power based perspectives; the realization that social andcultural 'non-economic' factors influence economic functioning and the increasing importance to space. In thispaper a concept will be presented, which contributes to the operationalization of these new perspectives in regionallabour supply modelling: the life-style concept.Life-style is the relative importance to different careers and can be considered as a latent variable. Life-style groupsare formed based on similar life-course patterns. These groups have different goals and choose a specificorganizational framework in line with these goals. Various back-ground characteristics of persons are assumed todetermine the life-style category someone belongs to.In this paper a review is made of the theory of the concept and its use in spatial research on the labour market. Thelife-style concept that will be used to model labour supply is specified and operationalized."

      "This paper extends the efficiency wages/partially adaptive expectations Phillips curve, otherwise known as the price-price Phillips curve, from a closed economy context to an open economy one with both commodity trade and capital mobility. We also consider the case of a monetary union (a country) with two member states (regions). The theoretical results are a priori ambiguous. However, in the first place, on resorting to plausible numerical simulations, economic openness increases the reactiveness of inflation to the unemployment rate. In regard to a monetary union, the national unemployment multiplier in the aggregate Phillips curve decreases with the weight of the member state in aggregate employment and increases with that in output. Secondly, we show in two empirical applications that our calibration can provide informative priors for models to be estimated thanks to the Kalman filter."

      "The primary objective of this paper is to highlight the contribution of the recent methodological refinements of poverty measures based on counting approaches using ordinal variables to the understanding of the evolution of poverty in Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Using the general framework proposed by Silber and Yalonetzky (2013), this paper compares multidimensional poverty measures such as the Multidimensional Poverty Index used by the UNDP (an index based on the approach of Alkire and Foster (2011)) with others which are sensitive to the distribution of deprivation counts across individuals. To the latter family belong the poverty measures introduced by Chakravarty and D'Ambrosio (2006) and Rippin (2010) and those based on the extension of the approach of Aaberge and Peluso (2012), as suggested by Silber and Yalonetzky (2013). Poverty is estimated using Demographic and Health Surveys for three different years for Cambodia (2000, 2005 and 2010), for Indonesia (1997, 2003 and 2007), and for the Philippines (1997, 2003 and 2008) by considering the deprivations in education, health and standard of living. Our findings indicate that Cambodia shows the highest level of poverty, followed by Indonesia and the Philippines, irrespective of the poverty measures used. At the national level, all countries reduced their multidimensional poverty over time using poverty measures as the one based on the approach of Alkire and Foster (2011) and those that are sensitive to the concentration of deprivations across individuals. As in most of Asian developing countries, poverty is largely a rural phenomenon. However, when examining the evolution of poverty over time for each country, conclusions drawn from the use of various poverty measures may differ regarding trends in poverty over time by area of residence as well as by region of residence."

Ein politisch unabhängiger, ausschließlich auf die Haushaltspolitik fokussierter EU-Währungskommissar könnte nach Ansicht von Thomas Straubhaar, Hamburgisches WeltWirtschaftsInstitut HWWi, die dritte Säule einer gemeinsamen Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion sein. Ob aber einem EU-Finanzkommissar wirklich die Kompetenz für präventive oder gar repressive Weisungen erteilt werden, sei aus heutiger Sicht mehr als fraglich. Somit dürfte der Vorschlag von Wolfgang Schäuble zwar logisch konsistent und in der Sache richtig, aber in der Praxis (noch lange) nicht durchsetzbar sein."

      "The reform introduced in Poland in 2009 substantially and abruptly reduced the number of workers eligible for early retirement. This paper evaluates the causal effects of this reform on labor force participation and exit to retirement. We use rich rotating panel from the Polish Labor Force Survey and exploit the discontinuity imposed by this reform. We find a statistically significant, but economically small discontinuity at the timing of the reform. The placebo test shows no similar effects in earlier or later quarters, but in a vast majority of specifications the discontinuity is not larger for the treated individuals, i.e. those whose occupation lost eligibility. We interpret these results as follows: the changes in the eligibility criteria were not instrumental in fostering the participation rates among the affected cohort, i.e. the immediate contribution to increased labor force participation of these cohorts is not economically large."

      "Resource misallocation can lower the aggregate total factor productivity (TFP). We use micro-data on manufacturing establishments from the Instituto Ecuatoriano de Estadística y Censos to quantify the differences in productivity and diagnose the efficiency in the allocation of resources between formal and informal firms in the Ecuadorian in the manufacturing sector. We use the model proposed by Hsieh and Klenow (Q J Econ 124(4):1403-1448, 2009) to find informal firms have lower physical productivity than formal firms. We also found formal firms have a restricted growth due to capital and output distortions. These results indicate the existence of an inefficient allocation of resources between firms. By reallocating resources to equalize marginal productivity in the manufacturing sector, we calculate TFP gains of 80% in 2002 and 69% in 2015."

      "Die Erreichbarkeit von Infrastrukturen der Daseinsvorsorge spielt sowohl für Standort-entscheidungen als auch für die individuelle Lebenssituation der Bürger eine wichtige Rolle, denn Erreichbarkeitsverhältnisse bestimmen neben der Qualität des Infrastrukturangebots den regionalen Versorgungsgrad mit Infrastruktur. Damit sind sie ein wichtiger Faktor der regionalen Entwicklung. Auch für die Diskussion über die Sicherung der Daseinsvorsorge sind aktuelle Informationen über die Erreichbarkeit von Einrichtungen der Daseinsvorsorge notwendig, um sich vor dem Hintergrund des normativen Anspruches der Aufrechterhaltung gleichwertiger Lebensverhältnisse im Bundesgebiet ein realistisches Bild über die derzeitige Situation als Ausgangsbasis für ggf. notwendige Politikinterventionen machen zu können. Vor diesem Hintergrund befasst sich die vorliegende Studie mit der Abschätzung der regionalen Erreichbarkeit von Ärzten, Krankenhäusern, Apotheken und ambulanten Pflegediensten nach Sozialgesetzbuch Elftes Buch (SGB XI) in Deutschland als - insbesondere in ländlichen Räumen - wichtige Schlüsseldienstleistungen für die Versorgung der Bürger. Dazu wird auf Basis eines rasterbasierten GIS-Erreichbarkeitsmodells ein einfacher generischer Erreichbarkeitsindikator ermittelt, der Rückschlüsse auf die Grundversorgungssituation flächendeckend für Deutschland ermöglicht.",
      "Accessibility is as important for location decisions and regional development as it is for the individual life situation of the citizens. The reason is that accessibility determines the regional quality and provision of services of general interest. Considering the normative political claim to provide comparable living conditions in all regions of Germany actual empirically sound information about the accessibility of services of general interest are important in order to get an objective and realistic impression about the current situation which can function as input for future policy actions and interventions. The study focuses on the estimation of the regional availability of physicians, hospitals, public pharmacies and ambulant nursing services according to the Social Security Code, Book Eleven (SGB XI) by analysing the accessibility based on a raster-based GIS accessibility analysis. Thereby the study especially focuses on the availability of such services in rural areas."

      "This article presents a narrative review of seven selected studies investigating the impact of digital innovation on entrepreneurship and its outcomes within diverse sociopolitical contexts. Results show that improved innovation output scores and the ability to absorb innovative models are associated with higher GDP growth rates. Technological changes account for 35-40% of the dynamics, while regional factors account for 40%. Internet usage has led to decreased operational costs, increased sales, and better customer interaction for 88% of companies, enabling 83% to expand their markets and 78% to engage more effectively with suppliers. Digitalization fosters entrepreneurship expansion into new markets, creating a positive feedback loop between the two variables. Additionally, the study found that government roles have a more significant influence on entrepreneurship sustainability compared to electronic readiness. Digital technologies have been shown to enhance firm productivity, particularly in manufacturing and intensive industries."

      "Wie in allen Bereichen des öffentlichen Sektors werden auch Verwaltungsleistungen und -prozesse an Universitäten zunehmend digitalisiert. Dabei liegt der Fokus oftmals auf dem studentischen Lebenszyklus, doch auch die Ressourcen-Verwaltung, wie beispielsweise die Personal- und Finanzverwaltung, werden verstärkt digital unterstützt. Dabei stehen oft Effizienzsteigerungen im Vordergrund. Zentrale Fragestellungen sind zudem die Nutzungsorientierung und die Auswirkungen der umgesetzten Lösungen. In dem vorliegenden Beitrag wird eine Studie vorgestellt, die am Beispiel der internen Genehmigungsprozesse von Beschaffungsanträgen und Drittmittelanzeigen an der Universität Potsdam untersucht, ob eine digitale Unterstützung durch das dafür eingeführte System die erwarteten Vorteile aufweist. Aufbauend auf einer Vorstudie zur erreichbaren Effizienzsteigerung werden nun auch die Kriterien Benutzungsfreundlichkeit und Akzeptanz in die Untersuchung einbezogen. Dafür wurden neben Datenerhebungen im System auch Nutzendenbefragungen durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse im Bereich Effizienz bestätigen die Aussagen der ersten Studie, dass nur in bestimmten Verwaltungsbereichen beziehungsweise Prozessschritten die Effizienz des Arbeitens durch den Einsatz digitaler Medien gestiegen ist. Diese werden nun in Empfehlungen für notwendige Ressourcen-Verschiebungen im Zuge der Digitalisierung der Verwaltung überführt. Darüber hinaus konnten detaillierte Hinweise abgeleitet werden, durch welche Hilfsfunktionen im digitalen Prozess das Arbeiten unterstützt wird und wie diese in den verschiedenen Bearbeitungsschritten genutzt werden. Zudem ergeben sich aus der Studie Erkenntnisse über die wahrgenommene Arbeitserleichterung und Transparenz in verschiedenen Bearbeitungsschritten. Diese und weitere Auswirkungen der Digitalisierung werden ausgewertet und diskutiert."

      "This paper explores the tradeoff options for optimal coastal land use in Krabi's coastal land development zone (CLDZ). Maximizing the net private benefit and maximizing the net environmental benefits, subject to the constraints set by land availability, effluent discharge from shrimp farms, and rice consumption are optimized via multiobjective programming. It is found that although the benefit from present land use pattern is close to the efficient level (Pareto frontier), reallocation of land use and revision of CLDZ are required in order to achieve an efficient outcome of planning. Designating aquaculture zones on the basis of carrying capacity is found to be an important scheme to control the impacts of shrimp farm discharges. The combined measures of carrying capacity and green taxation would lead to economically and environmentally responsible aquaculture. Compliance with aquaculture effluent standard alone could potentially lead to the detrimental optimum, and would be superfluous if aquaculture zones based on carrying capacity were designated."

      "This article explores regulatory developments with regard to employee representation in post-socialist corporate governance systems of Central Europe. It sets out to weigh the applicability of different theories on postsocialist industrial relations that focus on domestic, European and international forces. It pays special attention to the Hungarian case and studies regulatory developments in the early 2000s, with a focus on the third postsocialist Company Law of 2006. The article argues that the law reform undermines effective employee representation in postsocialist corporate governance systems. It concludes that these developments can only be adequately understood as the result of the interplay between various social forces at the national, European and international level.",
      "Dieser Beitrag erforscht die regulativen Entwicklungen hinsichtlich der Arbeitnehmervertretung im Kontext postsozialistischer Corporate-Governance- Systeme in Mitteleuropa. Er beginnt mit der Überprüfung der Anwendbarkeit von verschiedenen Theorien, mit Fokus auf inländische, europäische und internationale Kräfte, auf die postsozialistischen industriellen Beziehungen. Es wird speziell der ungarischen Fall untersucht, wobei die regulativen Entwicklungen zu Beginn dieses Jahrzehnts, und besonders das dritte postsozialistische Unternehmensrecht von 2006 im Zentrum der Betrachtung stehen. Es wird argumentiert, dass die Gesetzesreform eine wirksame Arbeitnehmervertretung in postsozialistischen Corporate-Governance- Systemen unterminiert. Zusammenfassend kann festegestellt werden, dass diese Entwicklungen nur als das Ergebnis des Zusammenspiels zwischen verschiedenen sozialen Kräften auf der nationalen, europäischen und internationalen Ebenen adäquat verstanden werden können."

      "Motivated by recent research on survey data, we test the influence of the political regime on social norms under controlled laboratory conditions. Comparing solidarity behavior revealed by East and West Germans in 1995 and 2009, we find that East Germans persistently show much less solidarity than West Germans. Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, social norms of solidarity have not converged. This suggests that norms of social behavior change much more slowly than the political environment."

      "This paper addresses the potential for conflict between antitrust authorities in the arena of merger control in the new economy. By “new economy” we mean two related developments. First, the internationalization of the economy, i.e. the ability to sell and produce products world-wide, and secondly, markets with certain characteristics such as network effects and other aspects of natural monopoly. We focus on three types of substantive issues in merger control - market definition, assessment of competitive effects, and the role of remedies. We argue that the scope for conflict varies significantly across these three arenas. In particular, conflict over market definition is less likely. By contrast, the assessment of competitive effects and the role of remedies are areas where conflict between antitrust authorities may be more likely in “new economy- type” markets.",
      "Diese Arbeit identifiziert Konfliktpotentiale zwischen Wettbewerbsbehörden in der Fusionskontrolle von New Economy-Fällen. Mit „New Economy“ bezeichnen wir zwei miteinander verbundene Entwicklungen: Erstens die Internalisierung der Ökonomien, womit die Möglichkeiten weltweit zu verkaufen und zu produzieren gemeint sind, und zweitens bestimmte Markteigenschaften wie Netzwerkeffekte sowie Produktionsbedingungen natürlicher Monopole. Wir fokussieren auf drei substantielle Problembereiche internationaler Fusionskontrolle: die Marktabgrenzung, die Einschätzung der Wettbewerbswirkungen und die Rolle von Abhilfemaßnahmen. Wir argumentieren, daß sich die Gefahren internationaler Konflikte sehr unterschiedlich über diese drei Bereiche verteilen. Insbesondere sind Konflikte über die Abgrenzung des relevanten Marktes weniger wahrscheinlich. Im Gegensatz hierzu sprechen eine Reihe von Gründen dafür, daß Konfliktsituationen sowohl bei der Einschätzung der Wettbewerbswirkungen von Fusionen als auch bei der Anwendung von Abhilfemaßnahmen wahrscheinlicher werden in New Economy-Märkten."

      "We use a subsample bootstrap method to get a consistent estimate of the asymptotically optimal choice of the samplefraction, in the sense of minimal mean squared error, which is needed for tail index estimation. Unlike previous methodsour procedure is fully self contained. In particular, the method is not conditional on an initial consistent estimate of the tailindex; and the ratio of the first and second order tail indices is left unrestricted, but we require the ratio to be strictlypositive. Hence the current method yields a complete solution to tail index estimation as it is not predicated on a more orless arbitrary choice of the number of highest order statistics."

      "While many studies explored impacts of political quotas for females, often with ambiguous results, underlying mechanisms and long-term effects have received relatively little attention. Nation-wide data from India spanning a 15-year period allow us to explore how reservations affect leader qualifications, service delivery, political participation, local accountability, and individuals' willingness to contribute to public goods. Although leader quality declines and impacts on service quality are ambiguous, gender quotas are shown to increase political processes and participation, the willingness to contribute to public goods, and perceived ability to hold leaders to account. Key effects persist beyond the reserved period and impacts on females often materialize only with a lag."

We next describe different ways of measuring the considerations that are on top of people's minds. We also provide an overview of methods to annotate and analyze such data. Next, we discuss different types of applications, including the measurement of motives, mental models, narratives, attention, information transmission, and recall. Our review highlights the potential of using open-ended questions to gain a deeper understanding of mechanisms underlying observed choices and expectations."

      "Metaphors and storytelling are important communication tools that play a significant role in leadership and organizational life. Leaders have used metaphors and storytelling to enhance their written and verbal communication from ancient times, since Aristotle, to the modern age. In the present research, we focus on the use of storytelling and metaphors by leaders in times of crisis. We perform a qualitative analysis of the public statements and addresses of the leaders of two different countries in the context of recent worldwide crises: The prime minister of Greece during the COVID-19 health crisis and the president of Ukraine during the outbreak of the conflict with Russia in 2022. Based on existing evidence, their effectiveness in convincing their subordinates and conveying their intended meaning either nationally or internationally during the aforementioned crises has been widely recognized. Our analysis reveals that both leaders have consistently utilized metaphors and storytelling in their efforts to be more convincing and empowering. We also find that the higher the intensity of the crisis, the more pronounced the use of metaphors and stories. We accordingly provide an analysis of the types and frequency of use of the aforementioned communication tools. Reflecting on our findings, we provide specific insight for practice by leaders, discuss theoretical implications, and suggest directions for future research."

      "This paper carries out an empirical assessment of the relationship between social capital and the quality of economic development in Italy. The analysis draws on a dataset collected by the author including about two hundred variables representing different aspects of economic development and four \"structural\" dimensions of social capital. The quality of development is measured through human development and indicators of the state of health of urban ecosystems, public services, gender equality, and labour markets, while social capital is measured through synthetic indicators representing strong family ties, weak informal ties, voluntary organizations, and political participation. The quality of development exhibits a strong positive correlation with bridging weak ties and a negative correlation with strong family ties. Particularly, the analysis shows a strong correlation between informal ties and an indicator of \"social well-being\" (synthesizing gender equality, public services and labour markets) and between voluntary organizations and the state of health of urban ecosystems. Active political participation proves to be irrelevant in terms of development and well-being. Finally, the role of public spending for education, health care, welfare work, and the environment protection is analysed, revealing a scarce correlation both with social capital and development indicators."

      "We investigate the nature and origin of comorbidity, defined as the tendency of members of marital couples to display correlated patterns of ill-health in later life. In the absence of long-term prospective data on couples, we use long-range recall data from the pan-European SHARELife survey and estimate a latent variable model of the health states of marital partners in childhood, early adulthood and late adulthood. We find strong persistence in health states and a strong comorbidity correlation, attributable almost equally to homogamy in relation to early health and common factors operating within marriage."

We use detailed national accounts published regularly by the OECD-financial assets and liabilities by institutional sectors (flow of funds). The ratio of private to public debt culminated mainly in the year 2007 and since 2008 this ratio has the tendency to decline. Spillovers across private and public debt have revealed mainly a mutual dependency. Cross-country differences have been discovered in both household´s and non-financial corporation´s debt."

      "This paper examines the effect of immigration directly on the overall utility of natives. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to explore such nexus. Combining information from the German Socio-Economic Panel dataset with detailed local labour market characteristics for the period 1997 to 2007, we investigate how changes in the spatial concentration of immigrants affect the subjective well-being of the German-born population. Our results suggest the existence of a robust, positive effect of immigration on natives' well-being. The presence of confounding local labour market characteristics has a negligible impact on the estimates. Furthermore, we find substantial evidence that the effect of immigration on well-being is a function of the assimilation of immigrants in the region. The effect of immigration is higher in regions with an intermediate level of economic assimilation and is essentially zero in areas where immigrants are either least or fully economically integrated. We conduct robustness checks to address the potential endogeneity between subjective well-being and immigration. Our tests indicate that natives are not crowded out by immigrants, and that the sorting of immigrants to regions with higher SWB is weak. This suggests that our main findings are not driven or strongly influenced by reverse causality or selectivity."

      "This paper analyzes whether hosting the most prestigious European cultural event, the European Capital of Culture, has an impact on regional economic development or the life satisfaction of the local population. Concerning the economic impact, we show that European Capitals are hosted in regions with above average GDP per capita, but do not causally affect the economic development in a significant way. Even a positive impact on GDP per capita would not imply a positive impact on individual utility or social welfare of the regional population. Surprisingly, using difference-in-difference estimations, a negative effect on the well-being of the regional population is found during the event. Since no effect is found before the event, reverse causality and positive anticipation can be ruled out. The negative effect during the event might result from dissatisfaction with the high levels of public expenditure, transport disruptions, general overcrowding or an increase in housing prices."

      "An increasing number of emerging and developing countries have adopted or are transitioning towards full-fledged inflation targeting (FFIT) as the main monetary policy framework to anchor inflation. In this paper, we explore the FFIT regime as a means for Mauritius to achieve stable inflation, anchor inflationary expectations and establish credibility in committing monetary policy towards price stability as its primary goal. This paper reviews and highlights issues experienced with the current monetary policy framework and the challenges in transitioning towards FFIT. Given that forecasting is central to FFIT, we develop a practical model-based forecasting and policy analysis system (FPAS) to support transition to FFIT, taking into account structural features and shocks that are specific to the Mauritius economy."

      "Strukturwandel ist kein temporäres Phänomen. Abhängig von der jeweiligen regionalen Wirtschaftsstruktur können sich Anpassungsprozesse an den Strukturwandel einfach oder schwerer gestalten und sich positiv oder negativ auf die wirtschaftliche Stärke einer Region auswirken. Deutschland weist sehr heterogene Regionen auf, die sich u.a. hinsichtlich ihrer Raumstruktur, Demografie oder wirtschaftlichen Stärke unterscheiden. Eine Disparität besteht insbesondere zwischen nord- und süddeutschen Bundesländern. Allgemein gilt, dass städtische Räume besonders vorteilhafte Wirtschaftsstrukturen aufweisen, um sich an aktuelle Trends erfolgreich anpassen zu können. In vielen ländlichen Regionen stellt sich dies anders dar. Vor allem in Nord- und Ostdeutschland finden sich Regionen, die deutlich gegenüber anderen Regionen aufholen müssen, um Wandlungsprozesse meistern zu können. In Regionen Thüringens oder Sachsens kommt erschwerend ein ausnahmsloser städtischer Konzentrationsprozess hinzu. Der Artikel zeichnet auf, wie sich aktuelle regionale Disparitäten darstellen und welche Regionen von künftigen Trends und Anpassungsprozessen profitieren können bzw. in welchen der Anpassungsdruck zunehmen wird. Es wird aufgezeigt, dass Veränderungen nicht durch strukturkonservierende Politik aufzuhalten sind, sondern vielmehr aktiv aufgenommen werden sollten, um den Wandel wirksam zu gestalten. Die öffentliche Hand sollte neben der Infrastruktur insbesondere in die Bereiche Bildung, Aus- und Fortbildung sowie Forschung und Entwicklung (F&E) investieren. Notwendig ist zudem eine Innovationspolitik, die verstärkt auf Kooperation und Vernetzung abzielt. Auf Norddeutschland übertragen impliziert dies eine stärkere, bundesländerübergreifende Kooperation in Forschungsvorhaben und Industriepolitik.",
      "Structural change and transformation is not a temporary phenomenon. The regional economic structure decides whether structural change has a positive effect on a region. In Germany, the process of structural change encounters heterogeneous regions that differ in terms of e.g. spatial structure, demography, or economic strength. Moreover, urban areas can adapt particularly well to current trends, while rural and peripheral areas threaten to fall behind. Those regions that are assumed to have a special need and a necessary catchingup process are mainly located in Northern and Eastern Germany. From a Northern German perspective, there has also been an unequal development compared to the Southern German federal states over a longer period. The article records how the current development of regional disparities is. It is shown that changes should not be halted by structurally conserving policies but should rather be taken up proactively in order to actively shape change. This requires an innovation policy that is increasingly aimed at cooperation and networking. Applied to Northern Germany, this implies a stronger, cross-federal state cooperation in research projects and industrial policy."

      "Consider a voting procedure where countries, states, or districts comprising a union each elect representatives who then participate in later votes at the union level on their behalf. The countries, provinces, and states may vary in their populations and composition. If we wish to maximize the total expected utility of all agents in the union, how to weight the votes of the representatives of the different countries, states or districts at the union level? We provide a simple characterization of the efficient voting rule in terms of the weights assigned to different districts and the voting threshold (how large a qualified majority is needed to induce change versus the status quo). Next, in the context of a model of the correlation structure of agents preferences, we analyze how voting weights relate to the population size of a country. We then analyze the voting weights in Council of the European Union under the Nice Treaty and the recently proposed constitution, and contrast them under different versions of our model, and compare them to the weights derived from poll data."

      "This paper investigates the macroeconomic and social determinants of voting behavior, and especially of political polarization, in 20 advanced countries using annual data ranging from 1970 to 2016 and covering 291 parliamentary elections. Using a panel estimation approach and rolling regressions, our analysis indicates that a significant change in the link between income inequality and political polarization appears to have taken place over the last twenty years. Indeed, we find that both average inequality, measured by the post-tax Gini coefficient, as well as the bottom 10%income share are statistically linked to the recent success of far-right parties, while the top 10% or top 20% incomes shares are not. The link of income inequality and political polarization thus seems to be based on the deterioration of the relative economic position especially of the poorest fraction of the population. Furthermore, we find no empirical support for the notion that social and economic globalization has led to an increase in the popularity of far-right parties."

      "Much of the empirical literature analysing the relation between environmental innovation and competitiveness has focused on the question whether 'it pays to be green'. We differentiate between different types of environmental innovations, which will be disentangled in those aiming at reducing the negative externalities and those allowing for efficiency increases and cost savings. What we analyze is at first the extent to which these two typologies have impacts on firms' profitability with opposite signs, and, secondly, whether the motivations driving the adoption of those innovations make the difference in terms of economic gains. We find empirical evidence that both the typology of Environmental Innovation and the driver of their adoption affect the sign of the relationship between competitiveness and environmental performance. The empirical strategy is based on a sample of German firms and makes use of a merge of two waves of the Mannheim Innovation Panel in 2011 and 2009 that allow overcoming some endogeneity issues which may arise in a cross-section setting."

      "The model of 'Open Innovations' (OI) can be compared with the \"Triple Helix of University-Industry-Government Relations\" (TH) as attempts to find surplus value in bringing industrial innovation closer to public R&D. Whereas the firm is central in the model of OI, the TH adds multi-centeredness: in addition to firms, universities and (e. g., regional) governments can take leading roles in innovation eco-systems. In addition to the (transversal) technology transfer at each moment of time, one can focus on the dynamics in the feedback loops. Under specifiable conditions, feedback loops can be turned into feedforward ones that drive innovation eco-systems towards self-organization and the auto-catalytic generation of new options. The generation of options can be more important than historical realizations (\"best practices\") for the longer-term viability of knowledge-based innovation systems. A system without sufficient options, for example, is locked-in. The generation of redundancy-the Triple Helix indicator-can be used as a measure of unrealized but technologically feasible options given a historical configuration. Different coordination mechanisms (markets, policies, knowledge) provide different perspectives on the same information and thus generate redundancy. Increased redundancy not only stimulates innovation in an ecosystem by reducing the prevailing uncertainty; it also enhances the synergy in and innovativeness of an innovation system."

      "The global food price shock of 2006-2008 has particularly affected poorer strata of populations in several developing countries. In Egypt and some other countries it has put food subsidy schemes to the test. This paper develops two comparable computable general equilibrium models for Egypt and Ukraine which are used to simulate direct and indirect impacts of the food price surge and various policy options on the performance of the main macroeconomic indicators as well as on poverty outcomes. The results illustrate the limited ability of realistic policy responses to mitigate negative social consequences of an external price shock. Food import tariff cuts are a partial remedy faring better than other analysed options. Furthermore, the Egyptian system of food subsidies needs substantial reforms limiting the related fiscal burden and improving the targeting of the poor population."

      "Given the substantial amount of resources currently invested in microcredit programs, it is more important than ever to accurately assess the extent to which peer monitoring by borrowers faced with group liability contracts actually reduces moral hazard. We conduct a field experiment with women about to enter a group loan program in Paraguay and then gather administrative data on the members´ repayment behavior in the six-month period following the experiment. In addition to the experiment which is designed to measure individual propensities to monitor under incentives similar to group liability, we collect a variety of the other potential correlates of borrowing behavior and repayment. Controlling for other factors, we find a very strong causal relationship between the monitoring propensity of one´s loan group and repayment. Our lowest estimate suggests that borrowers in groups with above median monitoring are 36 percent less likely to have a problem repaying their portion of the loan. Besides confirming a number of previous results, we also find some evidence that risk preferences, social preferences, and cognitive skills affect repayment."

      "The predictive power of the yield curve slope, or the yield spread is well established in the United States (US) and European Union (EU) countries since 1998. However, there exists a gap in the literature on the predictive power of the yield spread on the Chinese economy. This paper provides a different leading recession indicator using the Chinese and US economy as comparative examples: the user cost spread, being the difference of the opportunity costs of holding government securities of different maturities. We argue that the user cost spread, based on the Divisia monetary aggregate data like the ones produced by the Center for Financial Stability, provides improved predictive ability and a better intuitive explanation based on changes in the user cost price of holding bonds."

      "This paper uses directed bilateral flow data on multiple dimensions of economic integration to construct a composite index of regional integration outcomes covering 19 regions in various parts of the world. As a first step, the multidimensional indicator is used to rank regions according to their current degree of regional integration, which allows for a direct comparison of Asia's regional integration performance with those of other regions of the world. As a second step, the constructed indicator of regional integration outcomes is used as the output variable in a data envelopment analysis (DEA) to estimate Asia's untapped regional integration potential."

      "This conceptual paper aims at identifying a theoretical framework for the determinants of revenue management (RM) practices and their impacts on the financial performance of hotels. To create this framework, a two-phased process is employed where the first stage involves an explicit examination of the literature related to practices of revenue management and their determinants and to hotel financial performance. The second stage involves an enhancement of the framework. The theoretical structure is developed based on past theoretical explanations, and empirical analysis is conducted in the fields of revenue management. The researchers propose a theoretical framework illustrating how revenue management practices and their determinants affect the financial performance of Kenyan hotels. The use of contingency theory and its justifications and inadequacies among studies on revenue management in hotels is highlighted. The methods highlighted by the reviewed theoretical framework may be utilized to organize revenue management (RM) practices and their determinants for Kenyan hotels. Measurements for the financial performance of hotels are also described. Last, the researchers call for empirical research that authenticates the proposed model using a cross-sectional survey. The present work can inspire scholars and specialists to determine how RM practices and their determinants impact the financial performance of hotels. By assimilating knowledge from numerous disciplines, this paper emphasizes aggregated awareness surrounding the conceptualization of RM, RM practices adopted in hotels, and the financial performance of hotels."

      "European Union countries have implemented widespread reforms to product markets in order to stimulate competition, innovation and economic growth. We provide empirical evidence that the reforms carried out under the EU Single Market Programme (SMP) were associated with increased product market competition, as measured by a reduction in average profitability, and with a subsequent increase in innovation intensity and productivity growth for manufacturing sectors. In our analysis we exploit exogenous variation in the expected impact of the SMP across countries and industries to identify the effects of reforms on average profitability, and the effects of profitability on innovation and productivity growth. – Competition ; Innovation ; Productivity growth"

      "Overconfidence seems to be an essential aspect of human nature, and one way to study overconfidence is to consider students' forecasts of their exam grades. Part of a student's grade expectation is based on the student's previous academic achievements; what remains can be interpreted as (over)confidence. In this paper we study overconfidence using a sample of about five hundred second-year undergraduate students enrolled in a statistics course in Moscow. The course contains three exams and each student produces a forecast for each of the three exams. Students' expectations are not rational and most of students are overconfident, which is in agreement with what most people find. Less obvious findings are that overconfidence is helpful: given the same academic achievement students with larger confidence get higher exam grades. Female students are less overconfident than male students, their forecasts are more rational, and they are also faster learners in the sense that they adjust their expectations more rapidly."

The evaluation is based on computable general equilibrium model GTAP (global trade analysis project) that has been widely used in analyses of big regime changes in world economy. The results show that global free trade is better for all regions in the investigation. Compared to the current trade regime, that does not hold since e.g. the new EU member states would be worse-off. The biggest winners of global free trade are Asian countries, Brazil and developing countries."

      "In recent years employer branding has become increasingly important as a source of sustainable competitive advantage. Companies are trying to engender affective commitment in the best employees in a global labour market. In this study, we develop and validate a multidimensional scale to measure the strength of an employee's affective commitment to the employer brand in five separate studies. In Studies 1 and 2 the Affective Commitment to the Employer Brand (ACEB) scale was developed and tested for its structure, reliability and convergent validity. Study 3 examines additional reliability and discriminant validity. Study 4 provides evidence of external validity. Study 5 examines the scale's nomological validity showing that a positive experience with the employer brand is important in making the employee develop affective commitment towards it. The limitations of the scale and the boundary conditions of its applicability are also discussed.\""

      "We analyze the legal reform concerning employees? inventions in Germany. Using a simple principal-agent model, we derive a unique efficient payment scheme: a bonus which is contingent on the project value. We demonstrate that the old German law creates inefficient incentives. However, the new law concerning university employees and the pending reform proposal concerning other employees also fail to implement first-best incentives. With suboptimal incentives to spend effort on inventions, the government?s goal, an increase in the number of patents, is likely to be missed. (88 words)"

      "Introduction: Common approaches in cost-effectiveness analyses do not adjust for confounders. In nonrandomized studies this can result in biased results. Parametric models such as regression models are commonly applied to adjust for confounding, but there are several issues which need to be accounted for. The distribution of costs is often skewed and there can be a considerable proportion of observations of zero costs, which cannot be well handled using simple linear models. Associations between costs and effectiveness cannot usually be explained using observed background information alone, which also requires special attention in parametric modeling. Furthermore, in longitudinal panel data, missing observations are a growing problem also with nonparametric methods when cumulative outcome measures are used. Methods: We compare two methods, which can handle the aforementioned issues, in addition to the standard unadjusted bootstrap techniques for assessing cost-effectiveness in the Helsinki Psychotherapy Study based on five repeated measurements of the Global Severity Index (SCL-90-GSI) and direct costs during one year of follow-up in two groups defined by the Defence Style Questionnaire (DSQ) at baseline. The first method models cumulative costs and effectiveness using generalized linear models, multiple imputation and bootstrap techniques. The second method deals with repeated measurement data directly using a hierarchical two-part logistic and gamma regression model for costs, a hierarchical linear model for effectiveness, and Bayesian inference. Results : The adjustment for confounders mitigated the differences of the DSQ groups. Our method, based on Bayesian inference, revealed the unexplained association of costs and effectiveness. Furthermore, the method also demonstrated strong heteroscedasticity in positive costs. Conclusions: Confounders should be accounted for in cost-effectiveness analyses, if the comparison groups are not randomized."

      "Depletion of natural resources has become a key issue on the European policy agenda. Bottom-up measures have emerged in several countries with a view to promoting awareness campaigns and environmental sustainability, with the agenda set by individuals who start up collective initiatives at the local level. Such collective action provides an incentive to free-ride on the contribution of others. Social norms and the consequent behavior of individuals involved in collective action assume a key role in ensuring sustainable use of a public good, achieving significant, long-lasting success. The present study aims to ascertain which determinants most affect farmers' willingness to contribute to common resources. The empirical study was conducted in an area in the province of Avellino (southern Italy) most affected by soil erosion problems. The study focused on the willingness of farmers to contribute to the public good through biomass production (Giant Cane). In all, 175 face-to-face questionnaires were administered to farmers in September-November 2013. Schwartz's norm-activation model variables were collected. A Tobit model was implemented in which the dependent variable was the land farmers stated they were willing to cultivate with Giant Cane. Four on five psychological constructs, based on the NAM, proved statistically significant with the expected sign, showing that an altruistic behavioral approach is useful to predict the individual's decision to adopt cooperation norms."

      "Was bedeutet eigentlich \"Nachhaltigkeitsmanagement\" und wann handeln Unternehmen nachhaltig und wann nicht? Um möglichst präzise und vergleichbare Antworten auf diese Frage geben zu können, wurde mit der EU-Taxonomie ein umfangreiches Rahmenwerk vorgelegt, welches im Kern nachhaltiges Management transparenter und messbarer machen soll. Dieses Klassifikationssystem nachhaltiger Tätigkeiten hat zum Ziel, Kapital in nachhaltige Wirtschaftsaktivitäten zu lenken. Die Auswirkungen auf Unternehmen gehen über die bereits in weiten Teilen eingeführte Berichtspflicht zum eigenen Nachhaltigkeitsmanagement hinaus. Es zeichnet sich ab, dass Unternehmen, die die Kriterien der EU-Taxonomie nicht oder unzureichend erfüllen, empfindliche Wettbewerbsnachteile befürchten müssen. Obwohl die EU-Taxonomie sich noch im Anfangsstadium befindet, gibt es bereits heute schon ganz konkrete Auswirkungen auf die Unternehmenspraxis. Was sind diese Auswirkungen und welche Bedeutung haben sie insbesondere für Nicht-Finanzunternehmen? Auf diese Fragen gibt die vorliegende Schrift Antworten."

      "We present an incomplete markets model to understand the costs and benefits of increasing government debt when an increased demand for safety pushes the natural rate of interest below zero. A higher demand for safe assets causes the ZLB to bind, increasing unemployment. Higher government debt satiates the demand for safe assets, raising the natural rate and restoring full employment. However, this entails permanently lower investment, which reduces welfare, since our economy is dynamically efficient even when the natural rate is negative. Despite this, increasing debt until the ZLB no longer binds raises welfare when alternative instruments are unavailable. Higher in inflation targets instead allow for negative real interest rates and achieve full employment without reducing investment."

      "In this paper we discuss the potential for commercial microfinance in China. Particular emphasis is put on securitization of microloans and on structured microfinance in a China context. Three particular factors that we believe could support a strong growth in Chinese structured microfinance are (i) the lack of currency risk, (ii) the scale advantages and (iii) the massive potential interest from traditional, domestic as well as international, financial firms. On the policy side, structured microfinance could be an important tool for fighting unemployment in China. It could also be used to circumvent corruption or government bureaucracy in the microlending process."

      "The paper analyses in general the impact of digital labour platforms on employment in China, the key challenges and how digital labour platforms has contributed to job creation. It discusses in-depth the case of food delivery platforms and presents the findings about the impact of food-delivery sector on employment. By reviewing the national employment policies in China over the two decades, the paper shares the experience on how the national employment policy frameworks have evolved in response to different employment challenges. New challenges posed by digital labour platforms for the national employment policies are identified and based on the comparison with recent employment policies at national and provincial levels, the paper concludes with suggestions on how to promote decent employment in the platform economy by making employment policies beyond the traditional frameworks."

      "In order to investigate the effectiveness of science and technology industrial parks (STIPs), this study examines data on high-tech firms within and outside the STIPs in China, while paying special attention to the issues related to agglomeration and congestion. The main finding is that the negative effect of congestion on productivity is highly likely to outweigh the positive productivity effect of agglomeration economies within the STIPs but not among high-tech firms outside the STIPs. The paper also finds that the productivity of high-tech firms, whether within or outside the STIPs, are positively associated with foreign direct investment and the academic activities of local universities in the same city."

      "Somalia has been without effective state institutions since 1991. Over the past two decades, moderately effective state-like institutions have been rebuilt in Somaliland and Puntland in northern Somalia, but they do not enjoy international recognition and are limited in power and scope. This text concentrates on the integration of non-state actors, particularly traditional authorities, during the process of state-formation in Somaliland. Arguably, this integration has brought about a hybrid political system that functioned quite well during the first years of existence of Somaliland. Hybrid political systems are currently of great interest in various African settings, including the possibility of integrating traditional authorities into (local) government in South Sudan. These systems, however, mix modes of legitimacy of different political actors in a way that, in the long run, either undermines the democratic capabilities of modern states or seriously damages the credibility and effectiveness of traditional authorities. Thus, hybrid political systems may be a way to stabilize politics in a transitory phase (e.g., after civil war or independence) but they are not the easy way out of the dilemma that state institutions in many African states are weak, have only a very limited outreach and in many regards lack popular legitimacy."

      "We explore the impact of wage adjustment on employment with a focus on the role of downward nominal wage rigidities. We use a harmonised survey dataset, which covers 25 European countries in the period 2010-2013. These data are particularly useful for this paper given the firm-level information on the change in economic conditions and collective pay agreements. Our findings confirm the presence of wage rigidities in Europe: first, collective pay agreements reduce the probability of downward wage adjustment; second, the rise in the probability of downward base wage responses following a decrease in demand is significantly smaller than the rise in the probability of an upward wage response associated with an increase in demand. Estimation results point to a negative effect of downward wage rigidities on employment at the firm level."

Inzwischen ist auch bei Brot und Backwaren sowie bei Fleisch von deutlichen Preiserhöhungen die Rede. Verschiedentlich wird bereits gefordert, Sozialleistungen an die steigenden Lebensmittelpreise anzupassen. Die aktuellen Preisentwicklungen bei einer Reihe von Lebensmitteln haben indes nur geringe Auswirkungen auf die Inflation, und auch die besonderen Belastungen von Niedrigverdienern dürften sich in engen Grenzen halten. Seit Mitte der 90er Jahre sind die Preise für Nahrungsmittel in Deutschland wesentlich schwächer gestiegen als die Lebenshaltungskosten insgesamt, und das Preisniveau ist gegenwärtig eher niedriger als in den anderen größeren Ländern Westeuropas."

      "The literature on the development of Mexican social sciences during the twentieth century has rarely considered universities as part of the state. If we do, then universities are characterized by traits similar to those of the state, such as clientelism. This plausible hypothesis has never been fully unexamined. Another trait of the literature that impairs our knowledge of the Mexican social sciences is the neglect of external actors, in particular by US philanthropies. In this manuscript I argue that the Rockefeller Foundation patronised liberal scholarship, practiced according to formal rational criteria, as an alternative to what foundation officers perceived as clientelism and amateurism at universities. While in the long run foundations were extremely consequential for Latin American social sciences, and therefore frequently considered part of a US imperialistic drive towards cultural hegemony in Latin America, they were not unitary actors and frequently failed to predict the actual impact of their grants.",
      "Die Literatur die sich mit der Entstehung der Sozialwissenschaften Mexikos im 20. Jahrhundert befasst, hat selten unter der Annahme operiert, dass Universitäten selbst als Strukturen des Staats zu sehen sind. Wenn wir diese Annahme jedoch teilen, dann stellen wir schnell fest, dass Universitäten dem Staat höchst ähnlich sind, d.h. das sie vielerlei Charaktereigenschaften mit diesem teilen wie z.B. der Klientelismus. Diese plausible Hypothese wurde noch nie überprüft. Ein weiteres Defizit dieser Literatur ist die Nichtberücksichtigung von externen Akteuren, insbesondere amerikanischer philanthropischer Stiftungen. In diesem Papier argumentiere ich, dass die Rockefeller Stiftung eine freigeistige Forschung, ausgeübt nach formal-rationalen Kriterien, die sie als eine Alternative zu dem herkömmliche Unibetrieb, den die Angestellten der Stiftung als klientelistisch und dilettantisch wahrnahmen, förderte. Auf lange Sicht gesehen waren philanthropische Stiftungen prägend für die Entwicklung der Sozialwissenschaften in Lateinamerika und werden daher auch häufig als Bestandteil einer amerikanischen kulturellen Hegemonie verurteilt. Sie waren jedoch keine einheitlichen Akteure und ferner oftmals nicht im Stande den tatsächlichen Effekt ihrer Fördermaßnahmen einzuschätzen."

      "En el marco de las bases 1993 y 2004 de las Cuentas Nacionales, la información oficial disponible correspondiente a la masa salarial y sus componentes según sector y calidad del vínculo laboral cubre el lapso temporal 1993-2007, en el caso de la base 1993, y los años 2016 y 2017, para la base 2004. A ello se suma el dato del año base (2004), que en la actualidad no se encuentra disponible, pero que fue publicado en el marco del proceso de revisión general de las estadísticas públicas iniciado hacia fines de 2015. En consecuencia, no se dispone de la información correspondiente a la masa salarial y sus componentes según sector y calidad del vínculo laboral para el lapso 2008-2015, así como tampoco de una serie continua de tales variables para el lapso abarcado por los dos últimos años base de las cuentas nacionales. En este contexto, en el presente documento presentamos una estimación propia de la referida información para el lapso 2005-2015 en el marco de la base 2004 y, a partir de allí, una propuesta de empalme con la información correspondiente a la base 1993, de modo de completar el lapso 1993-2017.",

To this is added the data for the 2004 (base year), which is currently not available, but which was published within the framework of the general review process of public statistics, towards the end of 2015. Consequently, the information corresponding to the compensation of employees and its components according to sector and quality of the employment relationship for the period 2008-2015 is not available, nor is there a continuous series of such variables for the period covered between the last two bases of the national accounts. In this context, in this document we present our own estimate of the aforementioned information for the period 2005-2015 within the framework of the 2004 base and, from there, a proposal to chain with the information corresponding to 1993 base year, as a way to complete the 1993-2017 period."

      "Die Einführung einer Europäischen Arbeitslosenversicherung innerhalb des Euroraums könnte - je nach Ausgestaltung - zu einer merklichen Stabilisierung der konjunkturellen Entwicklung führen. Dies gilt selbst für eine gemessen am Transferumfang relativ kleine Europäische Arbeitslosenversicherung mit einer maximalen Bezugszeit von sechs Monaten und Leistungen in Höhe von 30 Prozent des letzten Nettolohns; mit größerem Leistungsumfang steigt die Stabilisierungswirkung, aber im Gegenzug auch die möglicherweise unerwünschten Wirkungen auf Arbeitsanreize und das Ausmaß der Umverteilung zwischen den Mitgliedsländern. Die Verteilungswirkungen mit Blick auf die privaten Haushalte sind gering; tendenziell finden sich leicht progressive bis neutrale Effekte auf die Einkommensverteilung in der Währungsunion. Haushalte mit niedrigeren Einkommen profitieren also überproportional von der Einführung einer Europäischen Arbeitslosenversicherung.",
      "Depending on how it is structured, the introduction of a European unemployment insurance within the euro area could make a significant contribution to stabilizing economic development. This even applies to a relatively small-scale system (based on the volume of transfers) with a maximum entitlement period of six months and transfers of 30 percent of the last net salary. Higher payments would amplify the stabilizing effect but, conversely, also increase the potential undesirable impact on incentives to work and the degree of redistribution among the member states. The distributive effects on households would be marginal; effects on income distribution in the Monetary Union would generally be slightly progressive to neutral. Low-income households therefore stand to gain more from the introduction of a European unemployment insurance."

      "The paper presents a new framework to assess firm level heterogeneity and to study the rate and direction of technical change. Building on the analysis of revealed short-run production functions by Hildenbrand (1981), we propose the (normalized) volume of the zonotope composed by vectors-firms in a narrowly defined industry as an indicator of inter-firm heterogeneity. Moreover, the angles that the main diagonal of the zonotope form with the axes provides a measure of the rates and directions of technical change over time. The proposed framework can easily account for n-inputs and m-outputs and, crucially, the measures of heterogeneity and technical change do not require many of the standard assumptions from production theory."

      "In this paper we challenge the conventional view that strikes are caused by asymmetric information regarding firm profitability such that union members are uninformed. Instead, we build an expressive model of strikes where the perception of unfairness provides the expressive benefit of voting for a strike. The model predicts that larger union size increases both wage offers and the incidence of strikes. Furthermore, while asymmetric information is still important in causing strikes, we find that it is the employer who is not fully informed about the level of emotionality within the union, thereby contributing to strike incidence. An empirical test using UK data provides support for the predictions. In particular, union size has a positive effect on the incidence of strikes and other industrial actions even when asymmetric information regarding profitability is controlled for."

      "We study a strategic market game with finitely many traders, infinite horizon and real assets. To this standard framework (see, e.g. Giraud and Weyers, 2004) we add two key ingredients: First, default is allowed at equilibrium by means of some collateral requirement for financial assets; second, information among players about the structure of uncertainty is incomplete. We focus on learning equilibria, at the end of which no player has incorrect beliefs - not because those players with heterogeneous beliefs were eliminated from the market (although default is possible at equilibrium) but because they have taken time to update their prior belief. We then prove a partial Folk theorem a la Wiseman (2011) of the following form: For any function that maps each state of the world to a sequence of feasible and sequentially strictly individually rational allocations, and for any degree of precision, there is a perfect Bayesian equilibrium in which patient players learn the realized state with this degree of precision and achieve a payoff close to the one specified for each state."

      "A coalitional matching is a two-sided matching problem in which agents on each side of the market may form coalitions such as student groups and research teams who - when matched - form universities. We assume that each researcher has preferences over the research teams he would like to work in and over the student groups he would like to teach to. Correspondingly, each student has preferences over the groups of students he wants to study with and over the teams of researchers he would like to learn from. In this setup, we examine how the existence of core stable partitions on the distinct market sides, the restriction of agents' preferences over groups to strict orderings, and the extent to which individual preferences respect common rankings shape the existence of core stable coalitional matchings."

      "In this article, we analyze the impact of learning from internationalization on small and medium enterprises' (SMEs) performance along different development paths. Drawing on the exploitation versus exploration logic, we use an alternative view of foreign operation modes (the learning perspective) to provide insights into the impact of such learning on technological and organizational innovation as well as overall performance. Our results, which are derived from a sample of 132 SMEs active in traditional manufacturing industries, point to a path to superior performance that entails resource-augmenting operation modes and organizational innovation."

      "Economic, political, and demographic changes, technological advances, two crashes of the economy, ethical scandals, and other developments in the business environment have strained the roles and enrollments of American universities' business schools. The b-schools have not responded adequately. Prevailing theories in many of the management disciplines have broken down, partly as a result of the same environmental changes. Again, schools and curricula have not adapted. Collegiate business education is in dire crisis. In this paper we document the crisis, note measures that have been taken - both constructive and otherwise - and make further suggestions for improving the situation."

      "The paper is an overview of diversity in history, starting as far back as the societies in classical Ancient Europe and traditional non-European societies, where differentiation was basically between the enslaved and free population and the out-of-caste in India. With the end of slavery the European feudal society adopted a functionalist tripartition based on priests, warriors and peasants. The analysis continues in pre-industrial Europe (1500-1800), where in many cities class struggle was represented by the conflicts between crafts and between cities, with some participation of the élites. In 17th century England only one class existed, and class struggle was the struggle inside one class. Other considerations on the stratification of pre-industrial society are related to classes inferred from empirical subjectivity, social hierarchy and horizontal and vertical solidarity. In industrial society, the paper discusses the Marxian, Weberian and Marshall models and the syncretism between status and class. The second part of the paper is devoted to diversity outside formal society with the definitions of the processes that generate the marginalization of people and social groups, while the third part of the paper concerns the urban milieu and social integration/differentiation. Considerations are made on urban topography (e.g. ghettos, \"miracle courts\", etc.) and on the relationship between topographic position within the urban tissue and positioning in the social pyramid. Finally, the last part of the paper is an excursus on the historiographic assumptions and policies toward diversity and marginality."

      "This study investigates the relation between human capital depreciation during family-related career interruptions and occupational choice of women in the (West) German labour market. In contrast to other studies that do not explicitly focus on family-related career interruptions, we find that short-term human capital depreciation during these career interruptions is significantly lower in female occupations than in male occupations. This holds for both high- and low-skilled occupations. Our findings support the self-selection hypothesis with respect to occupational sex segregation, i.e., women might deliberately choose female occupations because of lower short-term wage penalties for family-related career interruptions. Moreover, we find that particularly men employed in high-skilled male occupations face large short-run as well as long run wage penalties when they have a family related career break."

      "As a recent literature has demonstrated, men and women differ in their willingness to sort into competitive environments. In particular, men are more willing than women to compete. We investigate whether it is possible to reduce the gender gap in willingness to compete through an information intervention that informs participants of the gap and advises them about the potential earnings implications. We find that this simple information intervention reduced the gender gap, both in a laboratory study at a German university and in a field study with Swedish high school students. Whereas some participants (primarily high performing women) benefited from the intervention, others lost out. We discuss the implications for efficiency and policy."

      "This study examines how bribery influences bank debt ratios for a large sample of firms from 14 transition countries. We combine information on bribery practices from the BEEPS survey with firm-level accounting data from the Amadeus database. Bribery is measured by the frequency of extra unofficial payments to officials to \"get things done\". We find that bribery is positively related to firms' bank debt ratios, which provides evidence that bribing bank officials facilitates firms' access to bank loans. This impact differs with the maturity of bank debt, as bribery contributes to higher short-term bank debt ratios but lower long-term bank debt ratios. Finally, we find that the institutional characteristics of the banking industry influence the relation between bribery and firms' bank debt ratios. Higher levels of financial development constrain the positive effects of bribery whereas larger market shares of state-owned banks have the opposite effect. Foreign bank presence also affects the impact of bribery, albeit this effect depends on the maturity of firms' bank-debt."

      "This paper contains three important contributions to the literature on international migrations. First, it compiles a new dataset on migration flows (and stocks) and on immigration laws for 14 OECD destination countries and 74 sending countries for each year over the period 1980-2005. Second, it extends the empirical model of migration choice across multiple destinations, developed by Grogger and Hanson (2008), by allowing for unobserved individual heterogeneity between migrants and non-migrants. We use the model to derive a pseudo-gravity empirical specification of the economic and legal determinants of international migration. Our estimates clearly show that bilateral migration flows are increasing in the income per capita gap between origin and destination. We also find that bilateral flows decrease when destination countries adopt stricter immigration laws. Third, we estimate the impact of immigration flows on employment, investment and productivity in the receiving OECD countries using as instruments the push factors in the gravity equation. Specifically, we use the characteristics of the sending countries that affect migration and their changes over time, interacted with bilateral migration costs. We find that immigration increases employment, with no evidence of crowding-out of natives, and that investment responds rapidly and vigorously. The inflow of immigrants does not seem to reduce capital intensity nor total factor productivity in the short-run or in the long run. These results imply that immigration increases the total GDP of the receiving country in the short-run one-for-one, without affecting average wages and average income per person."

      "Economic conditions at the time of labour market entry can induce wage differentials between workers entering the labour market at different points in time. While the existence and persistence of these entry wage differentials are well documented, little is known about their interaction with employees' mobility behaviour. This paper contributes to this research area by analyzing the interaction between job mobility and entry wage differentials using German administrative data. The results suggest that labour market entrants earning less than the average starting wage are more likely to change jobs, directly from employer to employer as well as indirectly via an unemployment spell. In addition they are more likely to change occupation. Moreover, job mobility tends to reduce the effects of labour market entry conditions, implying that job mobility operates as an adjustment mechanism that mitigates entry wage differentials. These results hold not only for high-skilled, but also for medium-skilled and unskilled workers."

      "Power in wind turbines are traditionally controlled by varying the pitch angle at high wind speeds in region 3 of the wind turbine operation. The pitch angles controllers are normally driven by electrical or hydraulic actuators. The motivation of this research is to design and implement a pitch angle control strategy at the outer section of the blade via a separated pitch control at blade tip (SePCaT). A pneumatic actuator is implemented to drive the pitch angle control mechanism by incorporating pneumatic actuated muscles (PAM) due to its high power/mass ratio, high specific work, and good contraction ratio while maintaining low weight at the tip of the blade. A sliding mode controller (SMC) is modeled and implemented on a redesigned 5MW wind turbine numerically. The hypothesis is that the SePCaT control strategy is effective and satisfactory pitch angle trajectory tracking is achievable. The method is adopted, the system is modeled, and the response was observed by subjecting the model dynamics to desired pitch angle trajectories. Initially comparative controller response with respect to desired trajectory revealed satisfactory pitch angle tracking but further investigation revealed chattering characteristics which was minimized by incorporating a saturation function. SePCaT offers an effective pitch angle control strategy which is smaller, lighter, reliable and efficient."

      "Latin American countries have some of the highest levels of income inequality in the world. However, earnings inequality significantly changed over the last three decades, increasing during the 1980s and 1990s, declining sharply in the 2000s, and stagnating or even increasing in some countries during the last decade. Macroeconomic instability in the region in the 1980s and early 1990s, and the introduction of structural reforms like trade, capital, and financial liberalization, affected the patterns of relative demand and relative earnings across skill-demographic groups in the 1990s, increasing inequality. Significant gains in educational attainment, the demographic transition, and rising female labor force participation changed the skill-demographic composition of labor supply, pushing education and experience premium downward, but this was not enough to counteract demand-side trends. At the turn of the century, improved external conditions, driven by China's massive increase in demand for commodities boosted economies across Latin America, which began to grow rapidly. Growth was accompanied by a positive shift in the relative demand for less-educated workers, stronger labor institutions, rising minimum wages, and declining labor informality, a confluence of factors that reduced earnings inequality. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, particularly after the end of the commodities price boom in 2014, economic growth decelerated, and the pace of inequality decline stagnated. There is extensive literature trying to explain the causes of earnings inequality dynamics during the last three decades in Latin America. We discuss this literature regarding themes, methodological approaches, and key findings, emphasizing the latest perspectives. The focus is on earnings inequality and how developments in labor markets have shaped it."

      "The appropriate way to empirically estimate time-dated utility and time preferences based on experimental data has been subject to controversy. Our study assesses whether within-subject magnitude treatments are more appropriately modeled through utility curvature, variable asset integration or as magnitude effects in the discounting function. We find that modeling magnitude effects through utility curvature at the same time as allowing for variable asset integration gives theoretically more consistent parameter ranges than including magnitude effects directly in the discounting function. Models with constant discount rates and limited and constant asset integration are rejected. More restricted but variable asset integration gives close to linear utility functions but such models are less robust than a matching fund model which gives a better fit and is robust and stable across multiple samples."

      "Inward investments as the cornerstone of the entry mode choice are still considered a frontier issue within the field of internationalization - as judged from the academic interest as well as from the numerous articles published in scientific journals. Despite considerable progress in later years in formulation of theories, many weaknesses still exist within this field. A further development of theory is therefore needed. Nowadays emerging markets show the greatest activity in the field of internationalization, e.g the Russian market, which is considered by most potential entrants as a huge opportunity. The methods of entry and models of operations of international contractors in the Russian market, based on the investment decisions, are investigated in this paper.",
      "Direktinvestitionen als Eckpfeiler für den Markteintritt werden weiterhin als Randgebiet der Internationalisierung angesehen - sowohl vom akademischen Interesse her als auch in den veröffentlichten Artikeln der Fachliteratur. Trotz beträchtlicher Fortschritte in den letzten Jahren bei der Formulierung von Theorien existieren immer noch viele Schwächen innerhalb dieses Feldes. Deshalb ist eine weitere Theorieentwicklung notwendig. Heutzutage weisen die 'emerging markets' die stärksten Aktivitäten im Bereich der Internationalisierung, beispielsweise der russische Markt, der von den meisten potenziellen Marktteilnehmern als eine enorme Gelegenheit angesehen wird. Die Methoden des Eintritts und die Modelle der Kooperation der internationalen Anbieter auf dem russischen Markt werden, basierend auf ihrer Investitionsentscheidung, in diesem Beitrag untersucht."

      "Governments settle their financial obligations and pay for the public expenditures largely through finances generated from taxes. For many developing countries like Pakistan, the state authorities are still having difficulty to achieve tax compliance. Existing literature has yet to traverse individual's tax compliance behavior on developing countries. The current study, however, explores the relationships among voluntary tax compliance behavior of individual taxpayers with selected economic, social, behavioral and institutional factors. This individual tax compliance behavior is studied through the multi-perspective lenses of the theory of attribution, equity theory, expected utility theory, and social exchange theory. Quantitative design using the survey method was employed to collect data from 435 individual taxpayers through questionnaire. For testing linkage between constructs, through mediation and moderation tests, structural equation modeling technique was used. The results suggest that tax compliance simplicity has a larger impact on tax filing than perception about Government Spending and tax morale. Furthermore, perception of fairness significantly mediates the strengths between morale, simplicity, government spending and compliance behavior."

      "By simulating various (labour market) integration scenarios with the aid of a New Keynesian DSGE model, this paper explores the potential economic consequences and transmission mechanisms resulting from the recent refugee migration to Germany. We find that the long-run costs and benefits for domestic agents depend critically on the skill levels migrants will obtain in the long run. A failure to integrate the about 800,000 migrants (equivalent to 1% of initial German population) could reduce per capita output and consumption by 0.43% and 0.48%, respectively, while integration measures that improve their qualification structure could even yield per capita output and consumption gains of 0.34% and 0.38%, respectively. Measures that cause the migrant qualification structure to closely match that of the native population over the long term do not lead to significant changes in GDP and consumption. Overall, our model simulations suggest that the macroeconomic impact of refugee migration is small."

      "In this study, we examine the mediating roles of institutions in the remittances growth relationship for some reasons. We found that no country-specific study has towed this line leaving a vacuum in the literature of development and international finance. Most studies along this dimension have been done as a continental panel study with significant attendant deficiencies. Heterogeneous nature of institutional arrangements in African nations makes findings on the moderation roles of institutions in the remittance-growth relationship regional specific. We rely on the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) estimation procedure to establish a clear line of thought on the interactions of the variables of interest. Short-run results revealed that remittances inflow positively influence growth, but when institutional factors interact with the remittances variables, only the regulatory quality measures from the product of interactions matters for growth. Nonetheless, long run results revealed that remittances inflow was negatively related with growth, but when interacted with institutional measures and regressed on growth outcomes, we found remittances to positively and statistically influence growth outcomes for all the institutional measures adopted. Therefore, recipient nations should improve on the design and enforcement of laws particularly about their regulatory quality and as well as quality assurance such that they could be positioned to attract increased remittances inflow as well as other sources of external financing needed to augment domestic productivity and growth."

      "The relationship between inflation and economic growth is a contentious issue. The present study is undertaking to test hypothesis that the relationship between inflation and economic growth is nonlinear. This pane data study involves ASEAN-5 countries over the period 1980–2011. Panel Smooth Transition Regression (PSTR) model is employed to estimate the threshold of inflation and its effects on economic growth. Furthermore, we also check robustness by using GMM-IV specification. The study finds that there exists a statistically significant negative relationship between inflation and growth for the inflation rates above the threshold level of 7.84%, above which inflation starts impeding economic growth in the ASEAN-5 countries. The results suggest that central banks in the ASEAN-5 countries could improve economic growth by reducing inflation when it is above or near the estimated thresholds. The threshold inflation level can be considered, therefore, as inflation targeting indicator to conduct monetary policy.",
      "La relación entre la inflación y el crecimiento económico es una cuestión polémica. El presente estudio trata de probar la hipótesis de no linealidad la relación entre la inflación y el crecimiento económico. Este estudio de regresión fluida incluye a los países ASEAN-5 durante el periodo 1980–2011. Se utiliza el modelo -Panel Smooth Transition Regression (PSTR)- para calcular el umbral de la inflación y sus efectos sobre el crecimiento económico. Además, revisamos también la solidez utilizando la especificación GMM-IV. El estudio encuentra que existe una relación negativa estadísticamente significativa entre la inflación y el crecimiento para las tasas de inflación superiores al umbral del 7.84%, por encima del cual la inflación impide el crecimiento económico en los países del sudeste asiático. Los resultados sugieren que los bancos centrales de estos países podrían mejorar el crecimiento económico mediante la reducción de la inflación, cuando esta es superior o cercana a los umbrales estimados. Por tanto, el nivel umbral de la inflación puede considerarse como un indicador objetivo de la misma para la realización de las políticas monetarias."

      "This paper studies how credit constraints develop over bank relationships. I analyze a unique dataset of matched loan application and loan contract information and measure credit constraints as the ratio of requested to granted loan amounts. I find that the most important determinants of receiving smaller than requested loan amounts are firm age and size at the time of the first interaction between borrower and bank. Over loan sequences, credit constraints decease most pronouncedly in the beginning of relationships and for the initially young and small firms. Moreover, the structure of the dataset allows me to disentangle the demand and supply effects behind these observed credit constraints. I find that the gap between requested and granted loan amounts decreases because both sides converge. If previous credit constraints were large, requested amounts increase more moderately, while granted amounts increase more strongly than in the case of small previous constraints. The findings are a sign of the use of dynamic incentives at the bank side to overcome information problems when contracting repeatedly with opaque borrowers. The results further suggest that, particularly in the beginning of a bank relationship, borrowers learn from their previous experience with credit constraints and adjust their demand accordingly."

      "The Internet of Things (IoT) has been a major buzz word and is accepted as a future direction of ICT. One of the market's challenges is the formation of healthy business ecosystems. As IoT business inherently encompasses convergence of distinct industries, forming a healthy business ecosystem is challenging. However, there is only limited amount of studies concerning the business ecosystem evaluation. Thus, the current study intends to develop a viable model for assessing the healthiness of IoT business ecosystems. Factors affecting the IoT business ecosystems are suggested in the form of hierarchical decision tree, of which the first layer consists of stability, productivity, and diversity. In the second layer, 7 sub-criteria were presented under each major evaluation factor. Consequently, the health of three Korean IoT business ecosystems were assessed. Using the AHP method, the perceptions of 51 IoT researchers were analyzed. The results showed that the service oriented IoT business ecosystem alternative was the healthiest. Telecom firm's ecosystem showed well distributed capabilities in every factor. Meanwhile, tech-oriented firm's technological strength did not compensate its lack of value creation. Detailed theoretical, practical implications, and limitations of this study are also discussed."

      "This paper employs stochastic simulations of a small structural rational expectations model to investigate the consequences of the zero bound on nominal interest rates. We find that if the economy is subject to stochastic shocks similar in magnitude to those experienced in the U.S. over the 1980s and 1990s, the consequences of the zero bound are negligible for target inflation rates as low as 2 percent. However, the effects of the constraint are non-linear with respect to the inflation target and produce a quantitatively significant deterioration of the performance of the economy with targets between 0 and 1 percent. The variability of output increases significantly and that of inflation also rises somewhat. Also, we show that the asymmetry of the policy ineffectiveness induced by the zero bound generates a non-vertical long-run Phillips curve. Output falls increasingly short of potential with lower inflation targets."

Introduction of social commerce websites has bought shift in consumers&#x05f3; buying decision, i.e. from individual to social shopping. This study aims to identify factors that influence an individual&#x05f3;s decision to use social commerce websites in an Indian Context. A conceptual model was developed based on extensive literature review. Wherein total six factors that influence an individual&#x05f3;s intention to use social commerce were identified and were divided into three broad categories: social factors (informational support and community commitment), trust (towards members and community) and website quality (ease of use and service quality). Research model was empirically examined using structural equation modeling. The findings of this study demonstrated positive relationship between all six factors and an individual&#x05f3;s intention to use social commerce website. Additionally, study identified informational support as the most significant factor that influences an individuals's intention to use social commerce website followed by trust towards members, service equality, trust towards community, ease of navigation, and community commitment."

      "A conspicuous lacuna in the literature on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is the lack of clarity on variables key for driving and predicting inclusive growth. To address this, I train the machine learning algorithms for the Standard lasso, the Minimum Schwarz Bayesian Information Criterion (Minimum BIC) lasso, and the Adaptive lasso to study patterns in a dataset comprising 97 covariates of inclusive growth for 43 SSA countries. First, the regularization results show that only 13 variables are key for driving inclusive growth in SSA. Further, the results show that out of the 13, the poverty headcount (US$1.90) matters most. Second, the findings reveal that ‘Minimum BIC lasso’ is best for predicting inclusive growth in SSA. Policy recommendations are provided in line with the region’s green agenda and the coming into force of the African Continental Free Trade Area."

      "Some consumption opportunities are both indivisible and only valuable in particular tates of nature. The existence of such state-dependent indivisible consumption opportunities influences a person's risk attitudes. In general, people are not risk averse anymore even if utility from divisible consumption is concave. I propose a definition of insurance in the context of state-dependent preferences and investigate the different motives underlying insurance demand. The same reasons that rule out risk aversion turn out to be the basis of a desire to insure. This calls into question the standard approach that bases insurance demand on risk aversion with important implications for policy and research.",
      "Einige Konsummöglichkeiten sind nicht teilbar und nur in bestimmten Naturzuständen wertvoll. Die Existenz solcher zustandsabhängigen, unteilbaren Konsummöglichkeiten beeinflusst das Risikoverhalten einer Person. Im Allgemeinen sind die Menschen nicht mehr risikoscheu, auch wenn der Nutzen aus dem teilbaren Konsum konkav ist. Ich schlage eine Definition von Versicherung im Zusammenhang mit zustandsabhängigen Präferenzen vor und untersuche die verschiedenen Motive für Versicherungsnachfrage. Die gleichen Gründe, die Risikoaversion ausschließen, erweisen sich als Grundlage für den Wunsch nach einer Versicherung. Damit wird der Standardansatz in Frage gestellt, nach dem Versicherungsnachfrage auf Risikoaversion beruht, mit wichtigen Konsequenzen für Politik und Forschung."

      "What policy objective should a common central bank in a heterogeneous monetary union pursue? Should it base its decisions on the EU-wide average of inflation and growth or should it instead focus on (appropriately weighted) national rates of inflation and growth? We find that a central bank that minimises the national welfare losses reacts less to common shocks. However, average union-wide expected welfare is lower under a central bank that cares about union-wide variables if the variability of common shocks is large relative to the inflation bias. For a single country, welfare is lower in this case if its transmission mechanism is close to the average. The inflationary bias depends on the interaction between the transmission mechanism and distortions in labour markets."

      "The New-Keynesian Taylor-Rule model of inflation determination with no role for money is incomplete. As Cochrane (2007a) argues, it has no credible mechanism for ruling out bubbles and as a result fails to provide a reason for private agents to pick a unique stable path. We propose a way forward. Our proposal is in effect that the New-Keynesian model should be formulated with a money demand and money supply function. It should also embody a terminal condition for money supply behaviour. If an unstable path occurred the central bank would switch to a money supply Rule explicitly designed to stop it via the terminal condition. This would be therefore a threat/trigger strategy complementing the Taylor Rule - only to be invoked if inflation misbehaved. Thus we answer the criticisms levelled at the Taylor Rule that it has no credible mechanism for ruling out bubbles. However it does imply that money cannot be avoided in the new Keynesian set-up, contrary to Woodford (2008)."

      "Noise pollution is detrimental to health and to the cognitive development of children. This is not only true for extreme levels of noise in the neighborhood of an airport but also for traffic noise in urban areas. Using a census of preschool children, we show that children exposed to intensive traffic noise significantly fall behind in terms of school readiness. Being exposed to an additional 10 dB(A) counteracts the benefits to school readiness from about 3 months of kindergarten. We contribute to the literature and the policy debate on noise reduction by working with administrative data and focusing on everyday exposure to noise. The proposed method is easily applied to other regions. We assess the public costs of different abatement instruments and perform a cost-benefit analysis accordingly. It turns out that the commonly used abatement measures—e.g., quiet pavement or noise protection walls in densely populated areas of about 3,000 to 5,000 inhabitants per km2—are potentially cost efficient, even under a conservative assessment of the benefits."

      "In recent decades right-wing populist parties have experienced increased electoral success in many western democracies. This rise of the far-right, which is strongly built on the support of the working class, coincides with a sharp decline of the manufacturing sector. This paper analyzes the contribution of this manufacturing decline to the rise of the Austrian far-right. Overall the decline in manufacturing employment has strongly contributed to this rightward shift in the political landscape, with the manufacturing decline explaining roughly 43% of the observed increase in far-right vote-shares between 1995 and 2017. This effect is entirely driven by increases in natives unemployment rates, which increased considerably due to the manufacturing decline. Regarding the influences of the forces underlying the manufacturing decline, namely international trade and automation technologies, suggests that both forces contributed in roughly equal parts to this development."

      "We examine the returns from owning cows and buffaloes in rural India. We estimate that when valuing labor at market wages, households earn large, negative average returns from holding cows and buffaloes, at negative 64% and negative 39% respectively. This puzzle is mostly explained if we value the household's own labor at zero (a stark assumption), in which case estimated average returns for cows is negative 6% and positive 13% for buffaloes. Why do households continue to invest in livestock if economic returns are negative, or are these estimates wrong? We discuss potential explanations, including labor market failures, for why livestock investments may persist."

      "Recently, Constant, Gataullina, and Zimmermann (2009) established a new method to measure ethnic identity which they called the \"ethnosizer\". Using information on an individual's language, culture, social interactions, history of migration, and ethnic self-identification, the method classifies that individual into one of four states: assimilation, integration, separation or marginalization. A large body of literature has emerged examining the effects of immigrants' characteristics (age, gender, education, religion, etc.) on their ethnic identity using the ethnosizer. This note presents a basic theoretical framework to shed light on the vast collection of empirical results obtained on this topic."

      "Arrow (1963) hypothesized that demand-side moral hazard induced by health insurance leads to supply-side expansions in healthcare markets. Capturing these effects empirically has been challenging, as non-marginal insurance expansions are rare and detailed data on healthcare labor and capital is sparse. We combine administrative labor market data with the geographic variation in the rollout of a universal insurance program-the introduction of long-term care (LTC) insurance in Germany in 1995-to document a substantial expansion of the inpatient LTC labor market in response to insurance expansion. A 10 percentage point expansion in the share of insured elderly leads to 0.05 (7%) more inpatient LTC firms and four (13%) more workers per 1,000 elderly in Germany. Wages did not rise, but the quality of newly hired workers declined. We find suggestive evidence of a reduction in old-age mortality. Using a machine learning algorithm, we characterize counterfactual labor market biographies of potential inpatient LTC hires, finding that the reform moved workers into LTC jobs from unemployment and out of the labor force rather than from other sectors of the economy. We estimate that employing these additional workers in LTC is socially efficient if patients value the care provided by these workers at least at 25% of the market price for care. We show conceptually that, in the spirit of Harberger (1971), in a second-best equilibrium in which supply-side labor markets do not clear at perfectly competitive wages, subsidies for healthcare consumption along with the associated demand-side moral hazard can be welfare-enhancing."

      "This paper uses a new field survey of low-wage areas of urban India to show that employment and earnings were decimated by the lockdown resulting from the Covid-19 crisis. It examines workers' desire for a job guarantee in this setting. Workers who had a job guarantee before the crisis were relatively shielded by not being hit quite so hard in terms of the increased incidence of job loss or working zero hours and earnings losses. A stated choice experiment contained in the survey reveals evidence that low-wage workers are willing to give up around a quarter of their daily wage for a job guarantee. And direct survey questions corroborate this, with informal, young and female workers being most likely to want a job guarantee, and to want it even more due to the current crisis."

      "Myriad policy measures aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector, promote generation from renewable sources, and encourage energy conservation. To what extent do innovation and energy efficiency (EE) market failures justify additional interventions when a carbon price is in place? We extend the model of Fischer and Newell (2008) with advanced and conventional renewable energy technologies and short and long-run EE investments. We incorporate both knowledge spillovers and imperfections in the demand for energy efficiency. We conclude that some technology policies, particularly correcting R&D market failures, can be useful complements to emissions pricing, but ambitious renewable targets or subsidies seem unlikely to enhance welfare when placed alongside sufficient emissions pricing. The desirability of stringent EE policies is highly sensitive to the degree of undervaluation of EE by consumers, which also has implications for policies that tend to lower electricity prices Even with multiple market failures, emissions pricing remains the single most cost-effective option for reducing emissions"

      "This paper explores the potential spatial diversification of manufactured goods' exports in Saudi Arabia. To account for the spatial interactions of Saudi's manufactured goods' exports, we use a panel Spatial Autoregressive (SAR) model for 77 trade partners over the period 2000-2016. The empirical results suggest, firstly, the existence of spatial interdependence among Saudi's manufactured goods' exports. Secondly, we find that the exogenous variables including GDP, GDP per capita, trade freedom, bilateral exchange rate, and trade intensity index exert strong spillover effects on bilateral Saudi's manufactured goods' exports. Finally, the study demonstrates evidence of the highest potential with 34 out of 77 partners. This finding has important implications for policymakers, mainly in terms of development of the domestic manufacturing sector and geographic reallocation of Saudi's manufactured goods' exports."

      "This paper examines the determinants of the health of children ages 6 to 19, as reported in the Child Development Supplements (CDS) to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The primary focus is on the effect of religion on the reported overall health and psychological health of the child. Three measures of religion/religiosity of the child are employed: whether there is a religious affiliation (and what kind), the importance of religion, and the frequency of church attendance. Other variables the same, the analysis reveals that there appears to be a positive association between both measures of health and the three measures of religion/religiosity. Those children (self-report or primary caregiver report) who have identified a religious affiliation, who view religion as very important, compared to those who view it as unimportant, and who attend church at least weekly compared to those who do not or seldom attend have higher levels of overall health and psychological health. When the analysis of affiliation is done by denomination, the primary difference is between those who report a religious affiliation and those who do not."

      "Consumption smoothing and temporal price arbitrage are the two main economic motives for grain storage in semi-subsistence economies. Nonetheless, little has been documented on the determinants of households' grain storage behavior. Using a rich panel data from maize producing households in Ethiopia, this paper investigates the determinants of households' decision to store grain for consumption and/or for the market. We found that grain storage is mainly determined by climatic factors, technological innovations, and shocks. Grain storage for consumption and for the markets are not mutually exclusive decisions. While the decisions made by the households to store maize for consumption and for the markets are influenced by a host of similar factors, the effects of climatic factors and infrastructure are found to be heterogeneous."

      "We estimate a multivariate unobserved components-stochastic volatility model to explain the dynamics of a panel of six exchange rates against the US Dollar. The empirical model is based on the assumption that both countries' monetary policy strategies may be well described by Taylor rules with a time-varying inflation target, a time-varying natural rate of unemployment, and interest rate smoothing. The estimates closely track major movements along with important time-series properties of the real and nominal exchange rates across all currencies considered. The model generally outperforms a simple benchmark model that does not account for changes in trend inflation and trend unemployment."

      "Rapid population growth, urbanization, and income growth are triggering increased demand for high-value agricultural products across Southern Africa with scope for gains from trade and regional integration. We analyse the animal feed to poultry value chain in Zambia focusing on the industry capabilities with a view to enhancing its competitiveness and production for the regional market. The industry has exhibited rapid growth with investments, which has increased competition to consumers' benefit. However, challenges remain if it is to contribute to the regional market; animal feed input production and productivity remain low despite improvements. Similarly, produced poultry is in low quantities. Consequently, there is limited export of products due to higher prices. Enhancing value chain capabilities will require technology investments and public expenditure allocations that enhance productivity and production of animal feed inputs, and limited government intervention in maize marketing and trade which adversely impacts on maize prices."

      "In a two-period overlapping generations model, this paper demonstrates that the relationship between the environmental taxation and the economic activity (level- and growth-output) becomes inverted-U shaped, when the detrimental impact of pollution on health and the private decision of each working-age agent to improve her health are taken into account. Especially, a tighter environmental tax is more likely to promote (rather than to harm) output-level and growth when health is very sensitive to pollution, the weight of health in preferences is high, the polluting capacity of the production technology is high and the rate of natural purification of pollutants is low. The inverted-U shaped relationship between the environmental tax and the economic activity is due to a positive effect arising from the competition for resources between the final output sector and the health-enhancing activities that offsets the conventional detrimental drag-down effect for low values of the environmental tax. We also demonstrate that the link between the environmental tax and the lifetime welfare is inverted-U shaped as well. Finally, we investigate the social optimum and the determinants of the optimal environmental tax."

      "In konsumentenpsychologischen Experimenten mit 50 Kölnern und 50 Düsseldorfern im Alter von 35 bis 65 Jahren wurde untersucht, ob man Unterschiede zwischen den beiden Biersorten KÖLSCH und ALT erkennen kann. Dazu wurde zunächst in einem Blindtest der Geschmack von KÖLSCH und ALT beurteilt. Die Bewertungen von KÖLSCH und ALT bzgl. der Merkmale \"schmeckt mir\" sowie \"schmeckt frisch\", \"schmeckt mild\", \"schmeckt würzig\" waren nahezu gleich. Weiterhin wurde in einem Blindtest untersucht, ob die Versuchspersonen KÖLSCH und ALT überhaupt identifizieren können. Auch hierbei gab es keine signifikanten Unterschiede. Nur zu 55 % wurde das Bier richtig erkannt, was auf Zufalls- bzw. Rateniveau liegt. Später wurde in einem offenen Test nochmals der Geschmack für KÖLSCH und ALT untersucht. Jetzt zeigt sich, dass den Kölnern das KÖLSCH deutlich besser schmeckt als das ALT. Den Düsseldorfern hingegen schmeckt das ALT signifikant besser als das KÖLSCH. Eine Untersuchung der Präferenzen unterstützt diese Ergebnisse: Während in dem Blindtest die Präferenzen bei annähernd 50:50 lagen, veränderten sich diese im separaten offenen Test mit 78:22 zugunsten des Heimatbieres. Diese Ergebnisse sind schon erstaunlich, da einfach nicht zu glauben ist, dass Männer zwischen KÖLSCH und ALT objektiv nicht unterscheiden können. Die Ergebnisse werden ausführlich psychologisch und wissenschaftstheoretisch interpretiert und daraus Erkenntnisse für das Marketing abgeleitet.",
      "In consumer psychological experiments with 50 men of Cologne and 50 men of Dusseldorf between the age of 35 and 65, we examined whether there are recognizable differences between the two beers, KÖLSCH and ALT. Firstly, the taste of KÖLSCH and ALT was judged in a blind test. The results of the evaluation of KÖLSCH and ALT regarding the characteristics \"tastes good\", \"tastes fresh\", \"tastes mild\" and \"tastes aromatic\" were nearly equal. A further blind test examined whether the test subjects could actually recognize KÖLSCH and ALT at all. Again there was no significant difference - only 55 % of the beer was identified correctly which is on a random level. Later, the taste of KÖLSCH and ALT was tested again, but in an open test. This time the men of Cologne clearly prefer the taste of KÖLSCH. The men of Dusseldorf, however, find the taste of the ALT significantly better than the taste of KÖLSCH. A study of the preferences supports these findings: Whereas the preferences in the blind test, were nearly 50:50, the preferences in the separate open test changed to 78:22 in favour of the home beer. These results are quite amazing, because it is unbelievable that men cannot differentiate objectively between KÖLSCH and ALT. The results are psychologically and epistomologically interpreted in detail and thus insights can be derived for marketing."

      "This paper analyses (age-adjusted) employment rates by gender and education. We find that malefemale gender gaps and high-low education gaps in employment vary markedly across European Union (EU) countries and regions, with larger gaps existing in Eastern and Southern Europe than in Nordic and Continental EU countries. We estimate that closing existing education gaps in employment between high and lower education levels would raise the employment rate in the EU for the year 2022 by 10.6 percentage points, whereas closing the gender gaps between men and women would lead to an increase of 2.5 percentage points. At the same time, closing both the gender and education gaps would raise the EU employment rate from 76% to 89% of the population. Furthermore, we provide new evidence on the cyclical behaviour of employment gaps, finding that gender gaps are procyclical. While female employment rates tend to be more resilient than male employment rates during economic downturns, male employment rates tend to grow at a faster pace than female employment rates during upswings. In contrast, education gaps are more countercyclical, as employment risks are more strongly concentrated where education is low."

      "Bei der Analyse der rückläufigen Innovations- und Wachstumsdynamik moderner Volkswirtschaften lassen sich neben ökonomischen Ursachen auch kulturelle bzw. ethische Einflussfaktoren feststellen. Edmund Phelps hat in seiner Theorie zur Innovationsfähigkeit der Marktwirtschaft die Bedeutung nicht-monetärer Motive unternehmerischer Tätigkeit hervorgehoben, die sich auch durch einen Rückblick in die Geschichte der Industriellen Revolution(en) finden lassen. Aus aktueller Perspektive zeigt sich, dass die Einführung am Shareholder Value orientierter Ansätze der Unternehmenssteuerung und der Übergang zu finanzmarktbasierten Benchmarks im ausgehenden 20. Jahrhundert zu einer radikalen Veränderung der Motivationskultur in der Finanz- und Realwirtschaft geführt haben.",
      "When analysing the declining innovation and growth dynamics of modern economies, cultural and ethical influencing factors can be identified alongside economic causes. In his theory on the innovative capacity of the market economy, Edmund Phelps emphasised the importance of non-monetary motives for entrepreneurial activity, which can also be substantiated by looking back at the history of the industrial revolution(s). From a current perspective, the introduction of shareholder value-oriented approaches to corporate management and the transition to financial market-based benchmarks at the end of the 20th century led to a radical change in the culture of motivation in the financial and real economy. As a result, the ability to innovate was impaired by reduced investment in research and development, which was exacerbated by the misallocation of capital in the financial sector."

      "The authors consider a symmetric model composed of two countries and a firm in each country. Firms produce the same good by means of a polluting technology which uses fossil energy. However, these firms can adopt clean technology which uses renewable energy, having lower costs. Interestingly, opening markets to international competition increases the per-unit emission-tax and decreases the per-unit production subsidy. The socially optimal adoption date under a common market better internalizes transboundary pollution than that under autarky. In autarky (resp. a common market), firms adopt the clean technology earlier (resp. later) than what is socially optimal and, therefore, regulators induce clean technology adoption at the socially optimal adoption date by firms postponing (resp. speeding up) adoption subsidies. Opening markets to international trade speeds up socially optimal adoption dates and reduces global flow of pollution."

      "Semiconductor chips and their production are foundational for future innovation, future developments of digitalization, and economic prosperity. However, the role of production when discussing who is creating and capturing value across different industrial supply chains has often been underestimated. In this report, we analyze the distribution of the value added in the semiconductor supply chain. Value added analysis is insufficient on its own to understand the importance of production; therefore, we also examine the share of operating profits that has been reinvested in the growth of tangible and intangible assets. Based on value added and reinvesting cycle analysis, we discuss production intensity, and we draw conclusion regarding how important production is for different supply chains and industries."

      "Understanding the industrial structure of a national or regional economy is one of the central issues in economics. The triangulation of an input-output table (IOT) can be employed to understand the production structure of an economy. Inter-temporal and inter-regional comparisons of multiple IOTs have addressed interesting and important issues pertaining to international trade, economic growth, and inter-industry relationships in the economy. Rank correlation coefficients between sector rankings obtained by solving optimization problems have been utilized to quantify similarities among production structures. However, it is well known that calculated rank correlations might be weak even if underlying structures are similar because the optimization problem inherently has multiple optimal solutions, thus leading to erroneous interpretations. This paper proposes a new method to triangulate IOTs based on mixed integer programs (MIPs) for comparing the production structures of multiple economies. The proposed new method does not suffer from non-uniqueness of optimal solutions and is consistent with maximization of the Kendall rank correlation coefficient. The application of the proposed method to the Japanese economy demonstrates stability of the Japanese production structure during 1995 - 2005. Comparisons of triangulated IOTs further reveal similarities in production structures of the Chinese, Japanese, and the U.S. economy for the year 2009."

      "This article investigates the factors associated with income inequalities among a cohort of graduates from Brazilian courses in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in 2011, over a period of seven years after graduation. It analyses how the social origins of these individuals are mediated by the characteristics of higher education courses and institutions in their effects on labor income inequalities. To do so, various administrative records from the federal government, with a focus on educational and employment data, were cross-referenced, and indicators of the prestige and quality of the courses and higher education institutions were constructed. In addition to descriptive analyses of the employment trajectories of STEM graduates, multilevel regression models were used to estimate the effects of social origins and higher education on their remuneration. The results indicate the following: i) the influence of higher education on income inequality among STEM graduates is substantial but decreases over time; ii) the effects of social origins, gender, and race on income inequality are partially mediated by the trajectory in higher education; iii) this mediation is higher for parental education and lower for gender, highlighting both the role of education in reducing social inequalities and the discriminatory mechanisms inherent in the labor market, which persist despite individuals' educational trajectories; iv) indicators of institutional quality and prestige have significant effects on graduates' remuneration, and they can even fully absorb the effect of public institutions on income, indicating their potential for analyzing the heterogeneity of the higher education system; and v) the economic cycle played a strong influence on the occupational integration of graduates, and the type of employment obtained immediately after graduation is important for job quality in the medium term."

      "We analyze a Hotelling location-then-price duopoly game under demand uncertainty with uniformly distributed consumers in a standard quadratic costs scenario. The novelty of our approach consists of assuming that firms' beliefs are represented by non-extreme-outcome-additive (neo-additive) capacities. We derive firms' subgame-perfect product design decisions under ambiguity. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of ambiguity and ambiguity attitude on equilibrium product differentiation and contrast our results with an environment of risky firms. We find that the impact of the degree of confidence or ambiguity is particularly significant when it comes to delivering accurate explanations for a wide range of phenomena related to observed product design behavior."

      "The paper scrutinizes the spillover effects of expansionary monetary policies of a center economy to the macroeconomic policies of periphery countries, dependent on the exchange rate regime. In particular the impact of the US quantitative easing on the Chinese economy is analysed. The results suggest that the exchange rate regime plays a minor role in insulating the economies at the periphery of the world monetary system from monetary policy shocks in the center. The only exception is capital controls which enable the periphery countries, in particular China, to maintain a certain degree of monetary independence in the short run. In the long run a closer Chinese-European policy coordination is argued to create a counterbalance to the predominance of the US dollar in the currently asymmetric world monetary system. This would provide an incentive to the US to phase out undue monetary expansion."

      "Income disparities between poorer and richer households in Germany have been widening since reunification. Although this income polarisation is reduced during economically favourable periods by strong growth in employment, once the good times are over, it rises all the faster. The longer-term trend not only shows that the number of poorer households is steadily increasing, but also that on average they are getting poorer. On the flip side, the trend is toward an increasing number of richer individuals, whose average wealth is steadily increasing. This contrast is not only felt to be highly unfair, but also creates uncertainty among the middle class. Although the year of the financial crisis, 2009, saw the number of high-income households decrease, the average incomes of the remaining rich households continued to rise. As a result of job market measures, the lower income bracket has scarcely been affected by the financial and economic crisis."

      "Whether urbanization economies stem from urban diversity or urban scale is not clear in the literature. This paper uses the 2004 China manufacturing census data and tests simultaneously the effects of urban size and industrial diversity on firm productivity, controlling for localization economies and human capital externalities. We find that productivity increases with city size—but at a diminishing rate, and the city size effect becomes negative for cities with population over two million. Firms also benefit from industrial diversity, and the strength of such benefit increases with city size but decreases with firm size. The characteristics of agglomeration economies in a transition economy are also discussed."

      "Germany's system of economic and political governance strongly relies on group decision-making and consensus to solve economic issues. This approach relates to a wide spectrum of decisions, including the social partners with the trade unions and the employers' associations in wage formation, the trade unions in the governance of firms through codetermination and the workers' councils in the operation of firms, but also to relationship banking and to the steering of the university system by codetermination and by a governmental planning approach. In addition, in the governance of government and its federal structure, mechanisms of consensus are an important feature, above all through the joint responsibility of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat in law-making. Distributive federalism is another expression of the consensus mechanism. Looking at all these mechanisms, it is surprising how strongly the market economy is restrained in Germany."

      "Social protection systems in developing countries are typically composed of a bundle of benefits, the major ones being health insurance and pensions. Benefit bundling may increase informality and decrease welfare. Indeed, if some of the benefits are valued at substantially less than their cost, workers may choose to forego all benefits, even though some other benefits are valued at or above their cost. We examine the impact of benefit bundling using a series of Colombian reforms. The key reform is the unification of the payment systems for health and pension, which made it more difficult to contribute differently to the one plan versus the other. Using the progressive roll-out of the unified payment system by firm size, we show that benefit bundling increases both full formality and full informality by about 1 percentage point. The increase in full formality is concentrated among salaried workers in small to medium firms, while the increase in full informality is concentrated among independent workers."

      "This paper provides first empirical evidence of the joint effects that innovation strategies and human resource management practices exert on firm growth. By exploiting unique information from a large sample of Italian manufacturing companies in the very recent years, it shows that investing in technology and implementing performance-based pay policies are both positively associated with a significant turnover, employment and labor productivity growth premium. However, their joint adoption does not necessarily sum the two effects. In particular, performance-based rewards boost growth of non-innovators and of firms pursuing relatively simple innovation strategies, centered around the acquisition of embodied technology. For firms strongly relying on R&D as an additional lever for product and process upgrading, the estimated effect of having in place monetary incentive mechanisms is null or even negative."

      "Rapid urbanization could have positive and negative health effects, such that the net impact on population health is not obvious. It is, however, highly pertinent to the human welfare consequences of development. This paper uses community and individual level longitudinal data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey to estimate the net health impact of China’s unprecedented urbanization. We construct an index of urbanicity from a broad set of community characteristics and define urbanization in terms of movements across the distribution of this index. We use difference-in-differences estimators to identify the treatment effect of urbanization on the self-assessed health of individuals. The results reveal important, and robust, negative causal effects of urbanization on health. Urbanization increases the probability of reporting fair or poor health by 5 to 15 percentage points, with a greater degree of urbanization having larger health effects. While people in more urbanized areas are, on average, in better health than their rural counterparts, the process of urbanization is damaging to health. Our measure of self-assessed health is highly correlated with subsequent mortality and the causal harmful effect of urbanization on health is confirmed using more objective (but also more specific) health indicators, such as physical impairments, disease symptoms and hypertension."

      "We find that institutional ownership in publicly traded companies is associated with more innovation (measured by cite-weighted patents). To explore the mechanism through which this link arises, we build a model that nests the lazy-manager hypothesis with career-concerns, where institutional owners increase managerial incentives to innovate by reducing the career risk of risky projects. The data supports the career concerns model. First, whereas the lazy manager hypothesis predicts a substitution effect between institutional ownership and product market competition (and managerial entrenchment generally), the career-concern model allows for complementarity. Empirically, we reject substitution effects. Second, CEOs are less likely to be fired in the face of profit downturns when institutional ownership is higher. Finally, using instrumental variables, policy changes and disaggregating by type of owner we find that the effect of institutions on innovation does not appear to be due to endogenous selection."

      "Longitudinal, disease-level data are used to analyze the impact of pharmaceutical innovation on longevity (mean age at death), hospital utilization, and medical expenditure in Greece during the period 1995-2010. The estimates indicate that pharmaceutical innovation increased mean age at death by 0.87 years (10.4 months)- about 44% of the total increase in longevity -and that diseases with larger increases in the cumulative number of drugs launched 1-4 years earlier had smaller increases in the number of hospital days. Real per capita pharmaceutical expenditure increased rapidly during this period, but 62% of the increase in pharmaceutical expenditure was offset by a reduction in hospital expenditure attributable to pharmaceutical innovation. The baseline estimate of the cost per life-year gained from pharmaceutical innovation in Greece is $17,117, which is a very small fraction of leading economists' estimates of the value of (or consumers' willingness to pay for) a one-year increase in life expectancy."

      "The primary aim of this study is to investigate the relationship among the ethical leadership, ethical climate and integrity violation of the local government of two countries, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. Past studies indicate that ethical leadership and ethical climate influenced the integrity of local government. However, studies were mostly conducted in Western countries. Given the lack of comparative studies in Muslim-oriented countries, we intend to fill the gap by building upon previous studies on the relationship between ethical leadership and ethical climate and integrity violation of the local government. The study used survey to collect data from local authorities in the two nations. PLS-SEM was used to analyze the survey data. The findings demonstrated that the relationship between ethical leadership and integrity violation is not significant for Malaysians. Thus, the study assumption is not supported. By contrast, Saudi showed a different result in the relationship between ethical leadership and integrity violation; the relationship between ethical leadership and integrity violation in Saudi is negatively significant. Hence, the assumption is supported for Saudi participants. In regard to the ethical climate, results reveal that for Malaysia and Saudi, ethical climate negatively and significantly influence integrity violation. Thus, the assumption for both countries is supported. The findings of this study are useful for the practical development of local authorities as the findings provide information for the local government to safeguard against integrity violation. The findings also contribute social implications by educating organizations toward the role of ethical climate in preventing integrity violation. In addition, the study contributes to the growing interest in comparative studies."

      "This paper analyzes urban-rural disparities of China's child health and nutritional status using the China Health and Nutrition Survey data from 1989 to 2006. We investigate degrees of health and nutritional disparities between urban and rural children in China as well as how such disparities have changed during the period 1989-2006. The results show that on average urban children have 0.29 higher height-for-age z-scores and 0.19 greater weight-for-age z-scores than rural children. Urban children are approximately 40% less likely to be stunted (OR = 0.62; P < 0.01) or underweight (OR = 0.62; P < 0.05) during the period 1989-2006. We also find that the urban-rural health and nutritional disparities have been declining significantly from 1989 to 2006. Both urban and rural children have increased consumption of high protein and fat foods from 1989 to 2006, but the urban-rural difference decreased over time. Moreover, the urban-rural gap in child preventive health care access was also reduced during this period."

      "We propose dual regression as an alternative to the quantile regression process for the global estimation of conditional distribution functions under minimal assumptions. Dual regression provides all the interpretational power of the quantile regression process while avoiding the need for repairing the intersecting conditional quantile surfaces that quantile regression often produces in practice. Our approach introduces a mathematical programming characterization of conditional distribution functions which, in its simplest form, is the dual program of a simultaneous estimator for linear location-scale models. We apply our general characterization to the specification and estimation of a flexible class of conditional distribution functions, and present asymptotic theory for the corresponding empirical dual regression process."

      "As a manufactured fuel, hydrogen can be produced in a decentralized way in most countries around the world. This means, even in a net zero economy, the global trade of hydrogen could look quite different to the current international trade in fossil fuels, including natural gas. With further declines in the costs of renewable electricity and electrolyzers, regions which have lower cost renewable electricity may develop an economic advantage in the production of low-cost hydrogen, but for hydrogen to become a globally traded commodity, the cost of imports needs to be lower than the cost of domestic production. Unlike oil or natural gas, transporting hydrogen over long distances is not an easy task. Hydrogen liquefaction is an extremely energy-intensive process, while maintaining the low temperature required for long-distance transportation and storage purposes results in additional energy losses and accompanying costs. The upside is that hydrogen can be converted into multiple carriers that have a higher energy density and higher transport capacity and can potentially be cheaper to transport over long distances. Among the substances currently identified as potential hydrogen carriers suitable for marine shipping, liquid ammonia, the so-called 'liquid organic hydrogen carriers' in general (toluene-methylcyclohexane (MCH) in particular), and methanol have received the most attention in recent years. This paper compares the key techno-economic characteristics of these potential carriers with that of liquified hydrogen in order to develop a better understanding of the ways in which hydrogen could be transported overseas in an efficient manner. The paper also discusses other factors, beyond techno-economic features, that may affect the choice of optimum hydrogen carrier for long distance transport, as well as the global trade, of hydrogen."

      "This paper aims to study the mechanisms of the intergenerational transfer of poverty: it considers household poverty as a risk factor for youth poverty. The study is based on a unique, nationally representative School-to-Work Transition survey carried out in 2006 in Mongolia, one of the 50 poorest countries of the world. A young person born in a household living out of $1 a day has a ceteris paribus probability about 4 times greater of dropping out of school, 2.5 times greater of being educationally marginalized and 20 times greater of being a working poor than a contemporary born in a family living out of more than $3 a day."

      "This paper examines the social economic value of the Greenland off-shore shrimp fishery. The contribution of the fishery to the economy is examined using a cost-benefit analysis where the objective of the report is to examine the current state of the fishery rather than possible changes, which are a political decision. The analysis is undertaken by examining the state and development of the offshore shrimp fishery in Greenland, as well as the changes in profits, sales and production in the years 2006 and 2007. Financial accounts and costs data provided by the companies fishing in Greenland have contributed to estimating the net value of the industry. The management cost is included as well in the analysis. The paper concludes that there is a positive economic benefit from the shrimp fishery in Greenland, which is believed to be caused by the efficient management system of the fishery (based on Individual Transferable Quotas). It is further shown that the companies and the crew gains nearly the whole net-benefit from the fishery, while the public finance are not gaining much."

      "Less than half of the people with migration background living in Germany possess foreign citizenship. Hence, using citizenship to analyze economic issues of immigration may be problematic for two reasons. On the one hand, a quite substantial share of persons with migration background is neglected in the group of interest, and, on the other hand, the reference group (native Germans) may be contaminated by effects from naturalized immigrants. This paper utilizes a wider definition covering all persons with migration background to analyze the earnings prospects. To shed light on differences to the common use of citizenship, estimates are presented in comparison to foreigner and German citizens. The results show that persons with migration background have similar earnings prospects to foreigners. Moreover, earnings prospects for native Germans do not differ much from those of German citizenship. Therefore, using citizenship to approximate natives and non- natives when analyzing earnings issues seems to be reasonable. A second question of the paper is whether degrees obtained in Germany lead to better earnings prospects compared to degrees obtained abroad for persons with migration background. Independently of gender and skill level, the estimates affirm higher earnings to educational attainment in Germany."

In the cointegrating vector, there is evidence of a level shift, but the elasticities have not changed significantly. The income-elasticity remained close to the unity, and the real exchange rate multiplier was small. In the short-run dynamics, the world income exerts a nonnegligible influence, and the exchange rate is not significant. We estimate the correction of disequilibria occurs within three quarters. In addition, we underscore selected models exhibited a good performance in the outof-sample one-step-ahead forecast."

This cyclical inflation on the dollar’s periphery only registers in the US core consumer price index (CPI) with a long lag. The zero interest rate policy also fails to stimulate the US economy as domestic financial intermediation by banks and money market mutual funds is repressed. Because the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is forced to keep its interest rates below market-clearing levels, it also suffers from \"financial repression,\" although in a form differing from that in the US."

      "Widespread reliance on private tutoring has raised concerns over the hidden costs of Egypt’s “free” education system. This paper examines the drivers of tutoring at different levels of education, using nationally representative survey data as well as qualitative data on youth experiences in public, private, and religious schools. Our findings indicate that the drivers of tutoring are multiple and vary by schooling level. Structured around high-stakes exams, the Egyptian education system has fostered the growth of a diverse tutoring market. In general secondary school, tutoring has become a social expectation that leads teachers and students to shirk in school to devote more attention to tutoring. In basic education, teacher pressure is a major motivation for public school students to take tutoring. In order to reduce the prevalence of tutoring and ensure greater equality in education, there is an urgent need to test mechanisms for ensuring accountability in schools. ****** Please cite the published version: Maia Sieverding, Caroline Krafft, and Asmaa Elbadawy. 2019. “An Exploration of the Drivers of Private Tutoring in Egypt.” Comparative Education Review 63(4): 562-590. doi:10.1086/705383 - available online at: https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/705383 ******"

      "Auf globaler Ebene ist der Fleischmarkt durch eine zurückhaltende Importnachfrage bei ausreichend verfügbaren Exportmengen der Hauptproduktionsregionen gekennzeichnet. Etwas anders ist die Situation auf dem Rindfleischmarkt. Insbesondere die USA und China zeigen einen hohen Importbedarf. Der Weltmarkt wird vornehmlich von südamerikanischen Ländern und Australien beliefert. Die Situation innerhalb der EU kann mit einer Kaufzurückhaltung und der Suche nach preisgünstigen Fleischprodukten aufgrund der hohen Inflation erklärt werden. Hauptsächlich die Schweinefleischerzeugung wurde in nahezu allen EU-Ländern deutlich eingeschränkt. Auch in der Rindfleischerzeugung setzt sich der Rückgang fort. Schwache Nachfrage und hohe Preise (getrieben teilweise durch die Exportmärkte aber auch durch hohe Produktionskosten) sind die wichtigsten Gründe für diese Beschreibung. Auch in Deutschland setzt sich die zurückhaltende Neigung, Fleisch, insbesondere Schweine- und Rindfleisch zu kaufen und zu konsumieren, fort. Aufgrund der gestiegenen Erzeugungskosten sind die Erzeugerpreise und ebenfalls die Verbraucherpreise gestiegen, was nachfragedämpfend wirkt. Der Rückgang der Rinderbestände war in 2023 etwas geringer als in den Vorjahren. Es besteht weiterhin ein großer Unterschied in der durchschnittlichen Betriebsgröße zwischen den westlichen und östlichen Bundesländern. Trotz der hohen Erzeugerpreise in allen Rinderkategorien werden fortgesetzt weniger Tiere an die Schlachthöfe geliefert. Die Schweinebestände wurden in den vergangenen zwei Jahren massiv verkleinert. Allein in den vergangenen zwei Jahren gaben fast 20 % der Betriebe die Schweinehaltung auf. Entsprechend sanken auch die Schweineschlachtungen. Der massive Wandel der Schweinefleischerzeugung ist hauptsächlich durch den hartnäckigen Konsumrückgang in Deutschland und den Exportbeschränkungen aufgrund der weiterhin grassierenden ASP getrieben. Die Viehzählungsergebnisse sowie Außenhandelsdaten erlauben die Annahme, dass für die nächste Zukunft von einer stagnierenden bis nur leicht sinkenden Nachfrage ausgegangen werden kann. Das wäre eine Abkehr vom bisherigen Trend des starken Nachfragerückganges.",
      "At a global level, the meat market is characterized by subdued import demand and sufficient export volumes in the main producing regions. The situation in the beef market is somewhat different. The USA and China in particular have a high demand for imports. The world market is mainly supplied by South American countries and Australia. The situation within the EU can be explained by a reluctance to buy and the search for cheap meat products due to high inflation. Pork production in particular has been significantly reduced in almost all EU countries. The decline in beef production also continues. Weak demand and high prices (partly driven by export markets but also by high production costs) are the main reasons for this description. The reluctance to buy and consume meat, especially pork and beef, also continues in Germany. Due to higher production costs, producer and consumer prices have also risen, dampening demand. The decline in cattle numbers in 2023 census was slightly less than in previous years. There is still a large difference in average farm size between the western and eastern Länder. Despite high producer prices for all categories of cattle, fewer animals continue to be delivered to slaughterhouses. Pig herds have been massively reduced over the last two years. In the last two years alone, almost 20% of holdings have given up pig production. The number of pigs slaughtered has fallen accordingly. This massive change in pork production is mainly due to the continuing decline in consumption in Germany and export restrictions due to the ongoing ASF epidemic. The results of the livestock census and foreign trade data suggest that demand will stagnate or decline only slightly in the near future. This would be a departure from the previous trend of a sharp decline in demand."

      "The burgeoning literature on outward foreign direct investment from emerging markets has largely focused on analysing the motives of investors as reported by parent companies. This paper, instead, focuses on firm-level investments originating from China, India or South Africa in fifteen host countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The analysis is based on a sub-set of firms drawn from the overall sample of 1,216 foreign-owned firms participating in the UNIDO Africa Foreign Investor Survey, carried out in 2005. The sample of investments originating from China, India and South Africa is analysed in terms of firm characteristics, past and forecast performance in SSA over three years and management’s perception of ongoing business conditions. Comparisons are made with foreign investors from the North. The paper concludes that while investors in SSA from the three countries are primarily using their investment to target specific markets, they are largely operating in different sub-sectors. While there appear to be specific features that firms from a given country of origin share, there are no obvious operating-level features they all share apart from market seeking."

      "Recently, Finnish forest industries shifted from sectoral collective bargaining to firm-level bargaining, and the IT services industry shifted to a hybrid of sector- and firm-level bargaining. Using administrative data on monthly wages and the synthetic difference-in-differences method, I study the causal effects of collective bargaining decentralization on the level and dispersion of wages. Despite the substantial change in the level of collective bargaining, I generally find muted effects on the level and dispersion of wages. I find positive and economically and statistically significant effects on wage levels and within-firm wage dispersion only for blue-collar workers in the paper industry. The results are, in many respects, similar to those reported previously, especially by studies using credible designs. A possible explanation for the modest changes in the level and dispersion of wages is that employers still face fairly strong unions. Unions also have substantial bargaining power locally, which limits the scope of changes due to bargaining decentralization. It should also be noted that these results are short-term results and long-term results may be different."

      "This study describes the association between having children and the risk of union disruption, and whether this association has changed over time. We expand upon previous research by including data on cohabiting as well as married couples, and by studying change over four decades. We use data from the Norwegian Gender and Generation Study (2007) (N = 14 892). Combining self-reported union histories with register data on fertility histories, we construct a data set of person months for all individuals at risk of union dissolution in the period 1970-2007. Results from the event history analysis confirm that couples with children have lower union dissolution risk. Union dissolution risk is lowest when children are young, and also varies by number of children. There is little change over historical time in the correlation between having children and the risk of union dissolution. However, the monthly risk of dissolving unions increases substantially over time among childless as well as among parental couples."

      "This paper examines the relationship among poverty, economic growth, and inequality by decomposing poverty changes at subnational levels. The results were examined against the performances of the different economic sectors in the regions to understand the relationships while accounting for the nature of growth. Moreover, the poverty elasticity of output growth was estimated using regional-level data in 2003, 2006, and 2009. We learned that while the rate of growth matters a lot in poverty reduction, the redistribution of income matters as well. More importantly, we find that, at a given rate of growth, the response of poverty rate to growth is higher when income distribution is less unequal."

Twenty-five countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and data for the period 1980 to 2014 are used. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalised Method of Moments. First, trade imports modulate FDI to overwhelmingly induce positive net effects on TFP, real TFP growth, welfare TFP and real welfare TFP. Second, with exceptions on TFP and welfare TFP where net effects are both positive and negative, trade exports modulate FDI to overwhelmingly induce positive net effects on real TFP growth and welfare real TFP. In summary, the tested hypothesis is valid for the most part. Policy implications are discussed."

      "Cryptoeconomics describes an interdisciplinary, emergent and experimental field that draws on ideas and concepts from economics, game theory and related disciplines in the design of peer-to-peer cryptographic systems. Cryptoeconomic systems try to guarantee certain kinds of information security properties using incentives and/or penalties to regulate the distribution of efforts, goods and services in new digital economies. Cryptoeconomics is an embryonic field at present and can be taken to include several areas of focus: information security engineering, mechanism design, token engineering and market design. This portmanteau of cryptography and economics raises questions regarding the epistemic novelty of cryptoeconomics, as distinct from its constituent components."

      "Studies on health effects of unemployment usually neglect spillover effects on spouses. This study specifically investigates the effect of an individual's unemployment on the mental health of their spouse. In order to allow for causal interpretation of the estimates, it focuses on plant closure as entry into unemployment, and combines difference-in-difference and matching based on entropy balancing to provide robustness against observable and time-invariant unobservable heterogeneity. Using German Socio-Economic Panel Study data the paper reveals that unemployment decreases the mental health of spouses almost as much as for the directly affected individuals. The findings highlight that previous studies underestimate the public health costs of unemployment as they do not account for the potential consequences for spouses."

The goal of this research is to determine whether a specific group of immigrants can displace a group at the bottom of the ladder. We use Israeli data to compare two ethnic groups: Israeli Arabs and Ethiopian immigrants. Israeli Arabs were considered to be the least successful ethnic group in the Israeli labor market until they were displaced by the Ethiopian immigrants. The results of our analysis show that an ethnic group at the bottom of the wage ladder can be replaced by another."

    "abstract": [
      "The financial crisis and Great Recession have prompted a rethink of monetary policy and central banking. The status quo insider rethink focuses on the role of monetary policy in dealing with asset bubbles; making the central bank the banking system supervisor; and how to deal with the problem of the zero lower bound to nominal interest rates. This paper presents an outsider reform program that focuses on central bank governance and independence; reshaping the economic philosophy of central banks to be more intellectually open-minded; major monetary policy reform that includes adoption of an inflation target equal to the minimum unemployment rate of inflation (MURI) and implementation of asset based reserve requirements; and regulatory reform that addresses problems of flawed incentives, excessive leverage, and maturity mismatch.The proposed outsider reform program is rooted in a rethink of macroeconomic theory compelled by the crisis. There are some overlaps between the insider and outsider reform programs but they are more form than substance. That is dangerous because it can confuse debate if similarity of form is mistaken for similarity of substance.The insider program makes no changes to macroeconomic theory and is uncritical of the Federal Reserve's past actions. From its perspective, any failings of the Federal Reserve have been unwitting sins of omission. The outsider program fundamentally challenges existing macroeconomic theory and is also highly critical of the Federal Reserve. From its perspective the failings of the Federal Reserve have included significant sins of commission rooted in political capture, cognitive capture and intellectual hubris.The outsider critique can be taken even further. The Federal Reserve is already legally mandated to pursue maximum employment with price stability. However, it needs institutional transformation that makes it think of itself as an agent for helping realize the \"American Dream\". That means it should have a duty to shape the allocation of credit and the financial system in ways that ensure growth, full employment and a fair shake for all."

      "Im Mittelpunkt der Arbeit steht die Untersuchung des Stellenwertes und der Bedeutung von Innova-tionsnetzwerken bei der Gründungsentscheidung und nach erfolgtem Markteintritt. Für Unterneh-mensgründungen aus Wirtschaftszweigen mit hoher Innovationsintensität werden die Implikationen, die aus einer Netzwerkanbindung von ?start-ups? resultieren, empirisch näher analysiert. Die Untersuchungen zeigen zum einen, dass der Kontakt zu Innovationsnetzwerken einen positiven Einfluss auf dass Entscheidungsverhalten von Gründungswilligen hat. Die empirischen Analysen unterstreichen zum anderen, dass die Netzwerkmitgliedschaft eine wichtige Rolle nach erfolgtem Markteintritt spielt. ?Start-ups? können über die Erschließung externer Ressourcen intern vorhandene F&E-Kapazitäten erweitern und (finanzielle) Restriktionen in der Ressourcenausstattung abbauen. Dies ermöglicht es in besonderem Maße, Synergieeffekte zu realisieren und Strategien zur marktli-chen Verwertung von Innovationsanstrengungen zu erlernen. Multivariate Schätzungen zeigen schließlich, dass die Netzwerkmitgliedschaft einen positiven, statistisch hoch signifikanten Einfluss auf das Wachstum und den Markterfolg von Unternehmensgründungen - gemessen an der Umsatz- bzw. Beschäftigtenentwicklung - hat.",
      "The main focus of this paper is on the examination of the role and importance of innovation networks in the decision to found a firm and after entry to the market has taken place. For newly-founded firms from business sectors with high innovation intensity, the implications resulting from the involvement of ?start-ups? in a network of innovation are more closely analyzed. The examinations show, on the one hand, that contact to innovation networks has a positive effect on the decision-making behaviour of those wishing to found a firm. The empirical analysis, on the other hand, underline the fact that membership of a network plays an important role after entry to the market has taken place. By exploiting external resources, ?start-ups? can expand internally available R&D capacities and reduce (financial) restrictions on resource provision. This makes it possible to a notable extent to realize synergy effects and learn strategies for the commercial exploitation of innovation efforts. Finally, multivariate estimations show that network membership has a statistically highly significant effect - measured by turnover or the development of the number of employees - on the growth and market success of newly-founded firms."

      "Viticulture is an important activity in Romania, with a tradition since ancient times, it is ideal to cultivate especially for its geographical position and pedo-climatic conditions. In Romania, the area under vines is decreasing between 2015 and 2021, while total grape production is increasing considerably during this period. At EU level, Romania ranks 5th in terms of vineyard area and 6th in terms of total grape production, behind countries such as Italy, Germany, France, Portugal and Spain. Using the Forecast method, it is estimated that in 2030 the area under vines will reach 149 thousand hectares, the optimistic scenario shows that the area will reach 156 thousand hectares and the pessimistic scenario shows that the area will reach 99 thousand hectares. In the case of total grape production, it is estimated that in 2030, Romania will produce 99 thousand tonnes, according to the pessimistic scenario it will reach 1.42 million tonnes, and according to the pessimistic scenario it will reach 400 thousand tonnes."

      "With ever-increasing political tensions between China and Russia on one side and the EU and the US on the other, it only seems a matter of time until protectionist policies cause a decoupling of global value chains. This paper uses a computable general equilibrium trade model calibrated with the latest version of the GTAP database to simulate the effect of doubling non-tariff barriers - both unilateral and reciprocal - between the two blocks on trade and welfare. Imposing trade barriers almost completely eliminates bilateral imports. In addition, changes in price levels lead to higher imports and lower exports of the imposing country group from and to the rest of the world. The targeted country group increases exports to the rest of the world and reduces imports. Welfare falls in all countries involved, suggesting that governments should strive to cooperate rather than turning away from each other. By imposing a trade war on Russia, the political West could inflict severe damage on the Russian economy because of the latter's smaller relative size."

      "This paper examines the impact of the Anglophone Conflict in Cameroon on human capital accumulation. Using high-quality individual-level data on test scores and information on conflict-related violent events, a difference-in-differences design is employed to estimate the conflict's causal effects. The results show that an increase in violent events and conflict-related deaths causes a significant decline in test scores in reading and mathematics. The conflict also leads to higher rates of teacher absenteeism and reduced access to electricity in schools. These findings highlight the adverse consequences of conflict-related violence on human capital accumulation, particularly within the Anglophone subsystem. The study emphasizes the disproportionate burden faced by Anglophone pupils due to language-rooted tensions and segregated educational systems."

      "We relate to others in two important ways: we care about others, and we care about how we fare in comparison to others. In some contexts, these two forms of relatedness interact. Caring about others can conveniently be labeled altruism. Caring about how we fare in comparison with others who fare better than ourselves can conveniently be labeled relative deprivation. I provide examples of domains in which the incorporation of altruism and relative deprivation can point to novel perspectives and suggest rethinking, and possibly revising, long-held views. And I show that there are domains in which consideration of relative deprivation can substitute for the prevalence of altruism, and vice versa. I conclude that this is a fascinating sphere for research on economics and social behavior."

      "Internationally active firms rely intensively on trade credits even though they are considered particularly expensive. This phenomenon has been little explored so far. Our theoretical analysis shows that trade credits can alleviate financial constraints arising from asymmetric information because they serve as a quality signal and reduce the uncertainty related to international transactions. We use unique survey data on German enterprises to test the effect of the use of trade credits on firms' exporting and importing behavior, both at the extensive and intensive margins. Our results support the assertion that trade credits have a positive impact on firms' exporting and importing activities."

      "The objective of this paper is to examine the importance of energy and climate shocks in Uganda's food price processes. The unique features of this paper are threefold: first, we identify climate shocks computed as the deviations of monthly temperature and rainfall realisations from their respective long term means. Second, controlling for external and domestic shocks, we examine the possible role of energy prices in food price processes. Third, we examine these issues in a single equation model exploiting cointegration techniques and general-to-specific methods. Results indicate that energy prices have a long run cointegrating relationship with food prices. In addition, temperature shocks are more important than rainfall shocks in explaining food price variability."

      "From 2001 to 2015, Brazil experienced a profound reduction in income inequality. The commodities boom and some institutional changes in the early 2000s kickstarted the Brazilian labor market, increasing the quantity of formal jobs and earnings, especially for the poorest workers. Significant increases in average schooling and the real minimum wage helped reduce ethnic, gender, and regional earnings gaps, though all remain rather high. However, since 2014 a major fiscal crisis has negatively affected GDP and the labor market, seriously threatening these achievements."

      "Using longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, we analyze the effects of exposure to trade on the fertility and marital behavior of German workers. We find that individuals working in sectors that were more affected by import competition from Eastern Europe and suffered worse labor market outcomes were less likely to have children. In contrast, workers in sectors that benefited from increased exports had better employment prospects and higher fertility. These effects are driven by low-educated and married men, and reflect changes in the likelihood of having any child (extensive margin). While among workers exposed to import competition there is evidence of some fertility postponement, we find a significant reduction of completed fertility. There is instead little evidence of any significant effect on marital behavior."

      "The paper investigates the determinants of banking profitability and banking market conditions in Austria. We conduct a panel econometric analysis which allows for testing the hypotheses which have become the most prominent in the literature on bank profitability: the structure-conduct-performance hypothesis, the efficient-structure hypothesis and the relative-market-power hypothesis. Further, we test whether Austrian banking markets are, on average, contestable. A newly compiled dataset covering more than 700 Austrian banks ranging over the period from 1995 to 2002 is used to carry out these econometric analyses. The empirical findings support the view that the Austrian banks do exert, on average, some local market power. However, the gains in terms of excess profits are rather minor due to low deterrence powers of the incumbent banks."

      "This paper estimates the effects of nine exchange rates for european coun- tries vis-a-vis the Euro in the COVID pandemic. Using data on COVID cases, three containment and two stabilization measures relative to the euro area counterparts, it is shown that a more severe spread of the virus leads to a depreciation of the domestic currency. The same holds with respect to stricter movement restrictions, health care measures and more supportive monetary policies. More expansionary fiscal policies by the domestic country on the other hand lead to an appreciation of the currency. Two extensions show that the results differ with respect to whether the country is a scandinavian or eastern european country and whether the euro area countries or the other european countries introduce the measures."

      "This paper proposes a model that can be implemented to estimate the willingness to pay for distributive justice, defined as distribution according to desert. We derive a formula that allows one to recover the willingness to pay for distributive justice from fiscal data and the estimated coefficients of a probit regression. Using this formula and data from a 1998 Gallup Social Audit, we find that on average the monetary value of justice for US households amounts to about one fifth of their disposable income. Moreover, we find evidence of markedly heterogeneous preferences for justice along the lines of race and education."

      "Urbanization, as such, is not perceived as a threat to the environment and development but it is unplanned urban sprawl that affects the accessibility to amenities and land-use of any region. It is thus imperative to study and bring out the intricacies and implications associated with the problem of unplanned urban growth ensuing into sprawl. The methods used to measure the sprawl of Srinagar City are modified versions of SCATTER (The Sprawling Cities And Transport: from Evaluation to Recommendations) and Cost of Sprawl: 2000 TRB (Transport Research Bureau, US). The analysis reveals that the largest urban center in the fragile ecology of Himalayas has haphazardly grown during the last forty years which has resulted in disproportionate distribution of various civic amenities, socio economic and environmental variables. This phenomenon of urban sprawl in Srinagar City has been observed as a threat to achieving sustainable urbanization."

      "This paper examines efficiency in public input provision in two large jurisdictions with imperfect labour markets. It analyses how equilibrium capital tax rates and public input provision levels differ between asymmetric jurisdictions that can strategically influence the interest rate on the common capital market in an international tax competition setting. In contrast to the scenario assuming competitive labour markets, the non-cooperative equilibrium is inefficient also when governments have capital and head taxes at disposal. As a source of both the distortion in the capital allocation between jurisdictions and the inefficiency in public input provision, which can be determined in at least one of the jurisdictions, we identify the governments' incentives to decrease unemployment, and a pecuniary externality [De- Pater, J., Myers, G., 1994. Strategic capital tax competition: a pecuniary externality and a corrective device. Journal of Urban Economics 36, 66-78.] in both jurisdictions. Efficiency in public input provision can be restored, however, if the set of fiscal instruments available for regional policy makers is extended by a labour tax.",
      "Dieses Papier befasst sich mit der effizienten Bereitstellung produktiver öffentlicher Güter in zwei großen Gebietskörperschaften, die jeweils Marktmacht auf dem gemeinsamen Kapitalmarkt haben und sich durch imperfekte Arbeitsmärkte auszeichnen. Unter diesen Rahmenbedingungen können die Gebietskörperschaften auch den internationalen Kapitalmarktzins - und damit Zahlungen für Kapitalimporte bzw. Erträge aus Kapitalexporten - durch ihre Fiskalpolitik strategisch beeinflussen. Das Papier leitet die optimalen Kapitalsteuersätze und Bereitstellungsniveaus der öffentlichen Güter in den Regionen her, die sich abhängig von den institutionellen Rahmenbedingungen auf den Arbeitsmärkten und der Richtung der Kapitalflüsse unterscheiden. Die Möglichkeit der Gebietskörperschaften durch die Wahl ihrer Steuerinstrumente die Beschäftigung sowie den Kapitalmarktzins zu beeinflussen kann dabei Ursache einer Verzerrung der Kapitalallokation und einer ineffizienten Bereitstellung öffentlicher Güter sein. Eine effiziente Bereitstellung öffentlicher Güter kann hingegen gewährleistet werden, wenn das den Gebietskörperschaften zur Verfügung stehende Steuerinstrumentarium um eine Steuer auf das Arbeitseinkommen ergänzt wird."

      "Der Druck auf die chinesische Regierung, die Wechselkursbindung des chinesischen Yuan an den US Dollar aufzugeben, ist groß. Seitdem der Dollar unter kontinuierlichem Abwertungsdruck steht, wird in den westlichen Industriestaaten Chinas Festkurs einer merkantilistischen Handelspolitik gleichgesetzt. Aus der Sicht Chinas erscheint der Festkurs hingegen vorteilhaft. Aufgrund der Dollarisierung internationaler Zahlungsströme in Ostasien und eines hohen Bestandes an Dollar-Auslandsvermögen trägt die Wechselkursbindung zur makroökonomischen Stabilität Chinas und ganz Ostasiens bei. Es bleibt die Gefahr der Inflation, die über den Festkurs importiert wird. Der Überhitzung könnten eine Aufwertung des Yuan oder eine restriktivere Finanz- und Geldpolitik in den USA entgegen wirken.",
      "The pressure on the Chinese government to appreciate the Chinese yuan is large. Since the start of the dollar‘s sustained depreciation in early 2002 the western industrialized countries including Japan argue that China‘s fixed peg is equivalent to a mercantilist trade policy. From the Chinese perspective the peg seems beneficial. Due to the dollarization of international capital flows in East Asia and due to high international assets denominated in US dollars, exchange rate stability against the US dollar contributes to macroeoconomic stability in China and East Asia as a whole. There remains the danger of overheating which is imported via the dollar parity. This threat of inflation could be curtailed by both a yuan appreciation or a more restrictive fiscal and monetary policy in the United States."

      "We study the extent of overcrowding amongst British urban working families in the early 1900s and find major regional differences. In particular, a much greater proportion of households in urban Scotland were overcrowded than in the rest of Britain and Ireland. We investigate the causes of this spatial distribution of overcrowding and find that prices, especially rents and wages are the proximate causes of the phenomenon. In large cities, ports and cities specialising in old heavy industries high rent and overcrowding are more prevalent. Within cities, but not between cities, variations in infant mortality are clearly correlated with measures of overcrowding. All the findings are consistent with a core-periphery view of urban households choosing the location and size of housing to balance the health risks of overcrowding against the risks associated with lower and less regular incomes in places where rents are lower."

      "In theory, trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) have a positive impact on spillover of technology, demand for human capital and skilled worker wages, profits and total factor productivity. Conditions of increased competition at world scale affect both the production period and change and/or support factor intensities. Beside fast improvements in information technologies, FDI and trade relations play a fundamental role in this process. Free trade conditions and better investment climates contribute to improvements in skilled labor supply and its impact on economic fundamentals by affecting the product variety and quality through structural changes in factor endowments. The rise in skilled labor capacities in developing countries contributes especially to change the landscape of factor endowments. Within this context, production activities with new production models are segmented through more than one country. As a result, comparative advantages of advanced economies against emerging countries in high tech sectors have been easing in time. In this study, we research these developments via panel data regressions and cross table analysis. Developments in FDI and trade, in both total and high-technology goods, are examined for countries/regions including China, US, Japan and EU in the 2001-2009 period."

      "Due to pension reforms, minimum retirement age increased substantially in Italy between the second part of the 1990s and the early 2000s. We compare the training participation of pre- and post-reform cohorts of private sector employees and estimate that adding one year to minimum retirement age increases training incidence by 6.9 to 10.7 percent, depending on the empirical specification. We find that policies that increase the residual working horizon are effective in increasing training participation by senior workers, and that traditional training policies that aim at reducing training costs by providing subsidies are ineffective."

      "Hotelling’s famous ‘Principle of Minimum Differentiation’ asserts that two firms engaging in spatial competition with fixed prices will decide to locate at the same place. Interpreting spatial competition as modeling product differentiation, firms will thus offer products that are not differentiated and equally share the market demand. We extend (a fixed price version of) Hotelling’s model by introducing sequential consumer purchases and a second dimension of variation of the goods, quality. Consumers have differential information about the qualities of the goods and uninformed consumers observe the decision of their predecessors. With this extension a rationale for differentiating products emerges: Differentiation makes later consumers’ inference from earlier consumers’ purchases more informative, so that firms are confronted with two offsetting effects. On the one hand, differentiating one’s product decreases the likelihood that it is bought in earlier periods, but on the other hand, by making inference more valuable, it increases the likelihood that later consumers buy the differentiated good. We show that the second effect, the recommendation effect, can dominate, leading to an equilibrium with differentiated products. Our model thus introduces an aspect similar to the herding literature in that consumers might base their decisions on observable actions of others and thus potentially on ‘wrong’ decisions."

      "Using German firm-level data, an endogenous switching regression model within a production function framework is estimated in order to explore differences in labor productivity between IT outsourcing and non-IT outsourcing firms. This approach takes possible complementarities between IT outsourcing and production input factors into account and further allows IT outsourcing to affect any factor of the production function. Estimation results show that IT outsourcing firms produce more efficiently than non-IT outsourcing firms. Furthermore, they have a significantly larger output elasticity with respect to computer workers. Therefore computer workers and IT outsourcing can be interpreted as complementary factors positively affecting firms? labor productivity. An additional analysis indicates that IT outsourcing, in the medium-term, has a positive effect on firms? employment growth rate."

      "Recently the sequencing of the human genome has become a major biological and clinical research field. However, the public health impact of this new technology with focus on the financial effect is not yet to be foreseen. To provide an overview of the current health economic evidence for genome sequencing, we conducted a thorough systematic review of the literature from 17 databases. In addition, we conducted a hand search. Starting with 5 520 records we ultimately included five full-text publications and one internet source, all focused on cost calculations. The results were very heterogeneous and, therefore, difficult to compare. Furthermore, because the methodology of the publications was quite poor, the reliability and validity of the results were questionable. The real costs for the whole sequencing workflow, including data management and analysis, remain unknown. Overall, our review indicates that the current health economic evidence for genome sequencing is quite poor. Therefore, we listed aspects that needed to be considered when conducting health economic analyses of genome sequencing. Thereby, specifics regarding the overall aim, technology, population, indication, comparator, alternatives after sequencing, outcomes, probabilities, and costs with respect to genome sequencing are discussed. For further research, at the outset, a comprehensive cost calculation of genome sequencing is needed, because all further health economic studies rely on valid cost data. The results will serve as an input parameter for budget-impact analyses or cost-effectiveness analyses."

      "Using patent citation data for the U.S., we test whether knowledge spillovers in biotechnology are sensitive to distance. Controlling for self-citation by inventor, assignee and examiner, cohort-based regression analysis shows that spillovers are local but that distance is becoming less important with time. Network analysis paints a picture of a stable network between states, but a changing environment between individual actors, with a growing importance of connectedness. The popular maxim that everyone is connected by six degrees of separation is tested with surprising results."

      "Motorised individual transport strongly contributes to global CO2 emissions, due to its intensive usage of fossil fuels. Current political efforts addressing this issue (i.e. emission performance standards in the EU) are directed towards car manufacturers. This paper focuses on the demand side. It examines whether CO2 emissions per kilometre is a relevant attribute in car choices. Based on a stated preference experiment among potential car buyers from Germany, different mixed logit specifications are estimated. In addition, distributions of willingness to pay measures for an abatement of CO2 emissions are obtained. The results suggest that the emissions performance of a car matters substantially, but its consideration varies heavily across the sampled population. In particular, some evidence on gender, age and education effects on climate concerns is provided."

      "A growing body of literature indicates that competition increases bank soundness. Applying an industrial organization based approach to large data sets for European and U.S. banks, we offer new empirical evidence that efficiency plays a key role in the transmission from competition to soundness. We use a two-pronged approach. First, we employ Granger causality tests to establish the link between competition and measures of profit efficiency in banking, and find that competition indeed increases bank efficiency. Second, building on these results, we examine the relation between the Boone indicator [Boone, J. (2001) Intensity of competition and the incentive to innovate. IJIO, Vol. 19, pp. 705-726], an innovative measure of competition that focuses on the impact of competition on performance of efficient banks, and relate this measure to bank soundness. We find evidence that competition robustly increases bank soundness, via the efficiency channel."

      "We apply a probabilistic approach to the evaluation of climate change impacts in the Zambeze River Valley. The economic modeling relies on an economywide modeling approach. Taking a distribution of shocks as inputs, we create hybrid frequency distributions of the potential economic impacts of climate change for Mozambique. The approach identifies an explicit range of potential outcomes and associates a probability with given sets of outcomes. For example, we find that the economy of Mozambique may be up to 13% smaller in 2050 due to the effects of climate change. However, the chance of GDP losses of less than 5% are more than four out of five with about 10% of these outcomes actually positive. Large declines in GDP, defined as a decline greater than 10%, are the result of a dramatic reduction in flood return periods though the probability of large declines is relatively small at 2.5%. We conclude that this probabilistic approach provides significantly more information to policy makers and productively focuses scientific effort and the agenda for future research."

This paper does this. It derives and analyzes the demographic, economic and distributional properties of NDC. The residual (systematic) longevity risk creates a special problem, solved with an NDC bond, the asset that closes the system financially, transferring residual risk to the government (taxpayers). This guarantees a fixed NDC contribution rate and, thus, intergenerational commitment, with transparent distributional policy pursued through targeted transfers from general tax revenues and taxation of overall personal income."

      "I analyze whether variation in rainfall risk played a role for the speed of the demographic transition among American settlers. The underlying hypothesis is that children constituted a buffer stock of labor that could be mobilized in response to income shocks. Identification relies on fertility differences between farm and non-farm households within counties and over time. The results suggest that in areas with a high variance in rainfall the fertility differential between farm households and non-farm households was significantly higher than in areas with a low variance in rainfall. This channel is robust to other relevant forces such as income, education and children’s survival as well as the spatial correlation in fertility levels. The analysis also shows that this effect was reduced and finally disappeared as irrigation systems and agricultural machinery emerged. Hence, access to risk-mitigating devices significantly contributed to the demographic transition in the US. These findings also have potentially important implications for Sub-Saharan Africa, especially for those areas where income risks are a major threat to households and where fertility is still high and only slowly declining or not declining at all.",
      "In diesem Papier wird untersucht, ob Unterschiede in der Regenfallvariabilität eine Rolle für die Geschwindigkeit des demografischen Übergangs unter amerikanischen Siedlern gespielt haben. Dahinter steht die Annahme, dass Kinder eine Arbeitsreserve darstellen, die beim Eintreten von Einkommensschocks mobilisiert werden kann. Zur Identifikation dieses Mechanismus werden Fertilitätsunterschiede zwischen landwirtschaftlichen und nicht-landwirtschaftlichen Haushalten innerhalb von Counties über die Zeit genutzt. Die Ergebnisse legen nahe, dass in Gegenden mit einer hohen Regenfallvariabilität der Fertilitätsunterschied zwischen landwirtschaftlichen und nicht-landwirtschaftlichen Haushalten signifikant höher war als in Gegenden mit einer geringen Regenfallvariabilität. Dieser Wirkungskanal ist robust gegenüber anderen Kräften, die zum Beispiel über das Einkommen, Bildungsinvestitionen und Kindersterblichkeit wirken könnten. Ebenso hat der Effekt Bestand, wenn die räumliche Korrelation von Fertilitätsraten berücksichtigt wird. Die Analyse zeigt auch, dass der Effekt mit dem Aufkommen von Bewässerungssystemen und landwirtschaftlichen Maschinen zurückgeht und schließlich verschwindet. Dies suggeriert, dass der Zugang zu risikomindernden Instrumenten entscheidend zum demografischen Übergang in den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika beigetragen hat. Diese Ergebnisse haben grundsätzlich auch wichtige Implikationen für Sub-Sahara Afrika, insbesondere für die Gegenden in denen Einkommensrisiken eine besondere Belastung für Haushalte darstellen und in denen Fertilität immer noch hoch ist und nur langsam oder gar nicht zurückgeht."

      "Die Allgemeinfreiheit und rechtliche Schutzunfähigkeit von Ideen - und somit gleichermaßen von Werbeideen - gilt als eiserne Regel unserer Gesellschaft. Die Möglichkeit, bereits bestehende Ideen als Basis freischaffender Kreativität zu nutzen, sie umzuformen, neu zu erfinden und mit eigenen Gedanken anzureichern, sichert den kulturellen, wirtschaftlichen und technischen Fortschritt. Und dies kommt schließlich allen zu Gute. Warum sollte sich eine wissenschaftliche Arbeit also mit dem Schutz von Werbeideen beschäftigen? Die Antwort ist so einfach, wie entscheidend: Ideen sind Kapital! Ideen sind die Existenzgrundlage aller kreativ Schaffenden - und so insbesondere auch der Kreativen in der Werbebranche. Herausragende Werbung ist heute, in Zeiten von Informationsüberlastung und Aufmerksamkeitsverknappung, sowohl für werbungtreibende Unternehmen als auch für Werbeagenturen von existentieller Bedeutung. Einzigartige Werbeideen erzeugen ihre Aufmerksamkeit jedoch nicht nur bei den Adressaten der Werbung, sie dienen gleichermaßen als Maßstab sowie als Inspiration für viele Werbeschöpfungen anderer Kreativer in der Werbebranche. Und so kommen immer wieder Fälle von Ideenübernahmen ans Licht, die in der Branche vielfach diskutiert und kritisch - meist jedoch ausschließlich subjektiv - reflektiert werden. So herrscht eine fatale Diskrepanz zwischen der einerseits alltäglichen Präsenz von Plagiarismus und Ideendiebstahl in der Werbebranche und der andererseits fehlenden objektiven Ursachenanalyse sowie des stark fragmentierten und äußerst komplexen Status Quo rechtlicher Schutzmöglichkeiten.

      "We analyze a Cournot duopoly market with differentiated goods and the separation between ownership and control. We consider a delegation game, for which the owner of a firm hires a manager who acts as if the good has a lower degree of substitutability than it really has. This is so either because managers are biased and perceive the good in this way, or because firms design an incentive scheme accordingly, which leads the manager to act in this way. Both firms rely on delegation. We discuss conditions, which lead one firm to increase its profit implying that the usual result of a prisoners' dilemma is avoided."

      "A stream of research examining the effect of punishment on conformity indicates that punishment can backfire and lead to suboptimal social outcomes. We examine whether this effect is due to a lack of perceived legitimacy of rule enforcement, enabling agents to justify selfish behavior. We address the question of punishment legitimacy by shedding light upon the importance of social norms and their interplay with punishment. People are often presented with incomplete norm information: either about what most others do (empirical) or what most others deem appropriate (normative). We show that in isolation, neither punishment nor empirical/normative information increase prosocial behavior. In turn, we find that prosociality significantly increases when normative information and punishment are combined, but only when compliance is relatively cheap. When compliance is more expensive, we find that the combination of punishment and empirical information about others' conformity can have detrimental effects. In additional experiments, we explain how this negative effect is due, at least for some individuals, to punishment not being perceived as justified. Our results have important implications for researchers and practitioners alike."

      "We consider the problem of allocating multiple units of an indivisible object among agents and collecting payments. Each agent can receive multiple units of the object, and his (consumption) bundle is a pair of the units he receives and his payment. An agent's preference over bundles may be non-quasi-linear, which accommodates income effects or soft budget constraints. We show that the generalized Vickrey rule is the only rule satisfying efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and no subsidy for losers on rich domains with nondecreasing marginal valuations. We further show that if a domain is minimally rich and includes an arbitrary preference exhibiting both decreasing marginal valuations and a positive income effect, then no rule satisfies the same four properties. Our results suggest that in non-quasi-linear environments, the design of an efficient multi-unit auction mechanism is possible only when agents have nondecreasing marginal valuations."

      "Der Bau von Moscheen in deutschen Großstädten ist in Öffentlichkeit und in Medien in den letzten Jahren sehr kontrovers und teilweise heftig diskutiert werden. Bereits die Ankündigung einer geplanten Errichtung einer großen Moschee hat zu teilweise grotesk anmutenden Abwehrreaktionen geführt. Was genau auch immer die ablehnende Haltung mancher Bürger zum Moscheebau in ihrer Stadt oder in der Nachbarschaft im Einzelnen begründet, ist nicht Gegenstand dieses Beitrags. Vielmehr wird analysiert, ob Moscheen in Deutschland womöglich ein Beispiel für ein sogenanntes NIMBY-Gut sind, wobei NIMBY für Not In My Backyard steht. Mit NIMBY-Gütern werden in der ökonomischen Fachliteratur solche Güter bezeichnet, deren Existenz grundsätzlich von der Mehrheit der Bürger als sinnvoll angesehen wird, aber die man dennoch nicht gerne in seiner unmittelbaren Nachbarschaft haben möchte. Solche NIMBY-Güter stellen für Bürger und wirtschaftspolitische Entscheidungsträger ein schwierig zu handhabendes Problem dar. Unsere Analyse ist ein erster Schritt zur Quantifizierung der tatsächlichen Auswirkungen des Moscheebaus auf die Immobilienpreise in der umliegenden Nachbarschaft. Ein erstes vorsichtiges Fazit lautet, dass sich die Folgen für die betroffenen Nachbarn im Durchschnitt in Grenzen halten, auch wenn die Situation im Einzelfall anders gelagert sein kann. Mit Hilfe einer eher kleinen Stichprobe können zwar keine robusten wirtschaftspolitischen Empfehlungen abgeleitet werden - es ist aber festzuhalten, dass die Analyse keine Hinweise auf gravierende Einflüsse auf die Immobilienpreise in der Nachbarschaft liefert."

      "The extent to which like-with like marry is particularly important for inequality as well as for the outcomes of children that result from the union. In this paper we discuss approaches to the measurement of changes in assortative mating. We derive two key conditions that a well-defined measure should satisfy. We argue that changes in assortativeness should be interpreted through a structural model of the marriage market; in particular, a crucial issue is how they relate to variations in the economic surplus generated by marriage. We propose a very general criterion of increase in assortativeness, and show that almost all indices used in the literature are implied by our criterion - with one notable exception, that moreover violates one of our conditions. Finally, we use our approach to evaluate the evolution of assortative matching in the US over the last decades, and conclude that assortative matching has increased, particularly at the top of the education distribution."

      "The paper draws on Freeman, and the Aalborg group’s concept of national system of innovation (NSI) in order to build a framework upon which the author wants analyse of the Finnish system of innovation. Since the concept follows a neo-Schumpeterian approach of examining innovation and economic development, the framework that is outlined here addresses both historical and theoretical questions. Thus, it addresses questions regarding the main features of a system of innovation; the main characteristics of innovation and some alternative taxonomies that have been built for it; the on-going changes in techno-economic paradigm; some relevant aspects of information, knowledge and learning under the ICT techno-economic paradigm; and institutions and social capabilities responses which might be necessary to take place if a NSI is to play an active role in the global innovation processes, The paper also highlights the major elements of each one of the three domains of the FNSI (technological, economic and institutional) which will be taken into consideration in the analysis of the FNSI."

      "Distinguishing between short-run and long-run outcomes we provide new insight into the relationship between education and migration. We examine the specific link between the acquisition of high levels of human capital in the form of university education in Turkey and migration to Germany. We implement bounds testing procedures to ascertain the long-run relationships with the variables of interest in a migration model. Although the bounds testing procedure has advantages compared to other methods, it has not been widely implemented in the migration literature. We find a negative and decreasing non-linear long-run and short-run relationship between home country university education and Turkish migration to Germany over 1970-2015. Over the long run, increased higher education reduces emigration flows."

      "This paper uses data from the BRFSS over the period 2014-2019 to analyse the impact of removing surgical requirements to change legal gender. In many states transgender people are forced to undergo surgical procedures if they wish to change their gender on ID documents, which can be invasive, expensive, and is not always desired. In the present work state variation in the timing of the removal of surgical requirements is exploited within a triple difference framework to analyse the causal impact of these removals on the labour force participation and employment of transgender people. The findings highlight the detrimental economic impact of surgical requirements for transgender people to be able to reassign gender on birth certificates, especially for those individuals that are least likely to be able to afford surgical treatment."

The analysis includes estimations of determinants of on-thejob training, and of how much such training contributes to improvements in individual productivity. We employ original assembler survey data from two Japanese automobile makers. We also investigate effects of the characteristics of workplace practices, including the behavior of foremen, on the incentives for individual assemblers to seek job training and productivity improvements."

      "The present paper aims to present the picture of the Third Sector in Romania, today and the way it relates to Law 219/2015 on the Social Economy. It was analyzed the current legislative text and the specific laws on establishing and functioning of the key organizations concerned. It has been made a documentary on statistical data provided by institutions such as The National Office of the Trade, The National Bank of Romania, the Institute of Social Economy. To analyze the degree of knowledge of the law by the potential beneficiaries and their opinion on the current legislative approach, there were conducted semi-structured interviews and questionnaires were administered by phone and e-mail. Responders were chosen from the representatives of NGOs and cooperative federal bodies. It was found that the Third Sector has experienced a steady development in recent years but not all the organizations listed by law can become or are interested in becoming Social Enterprises. Due to legislative inconsistencies, bureaucracy and the lack of fiscal or financial incentives, the degree of interest in obtaining the status of a social enterprise is currently low. It remains to be seen whether future developments draw attention to Law 219/2015 and to related legislative approaches. But, regardless of this, the return to the basic principles of the social economy in the XIX-th century of which the connection between the economic activity and the social and moral values to be respected and the way to make efficient the own economic activity even without governmental or European financial assistance may have a decisive role for the development of the Social Economy sector in Romania and in Europe in general."

      "The ecological literature suggests that biodiversity reduces the variance of ecosystem services. Thus, conservative biodiversity management has an insurance value to risk-averse users of ecosystem services. We analyze a conceptual ecological-economic model in which such management measures generate a private benefit and, via ecosystem processes at higher hierarchical levels, a positive externality on other ecosystem users. We find that ecosystem management and environmental policy depend on the extent of uncertainty and risk-aversion as follows: (i) Individual effort to improve ecosystem quality unambiguously increases. The free-rider problem may decrease or increase, depending on the characteristics of the ecosystem and its management; in particular, (ii) the size of the externality may decrease or increase, depending on how individual and aggregate management effort influence biodiversity; and (iii) the welfare loss due to free-riding may decrease or increase, depending on how biodiversity influences ecosystem service provision."

      "Over the last few years a growing number of contributions have shown that the presence of business groups, i.e. sets of firms legally distinct but belonging to the same owner(s), is significant. From a theoretical point of view, this presence poses the question of whether the group or the single legal unit should be considered as the elementary unit in economic analysis: i.e., what is generally meant in microeconomic theory by 'firm'. In this paper we consider the group as the appropriate unit to delimit the firm's boundary, i.e. as the 'observed' organizational form adopted by firms when they grow in size. Starting from this hypothesis, the main aim of this paper is to analyse the role of structural variables, such as spatial agglomeration and technology, in determining some features of business groups' strategy and organization. Specifically, the analysis concerns the presence and organizational specificity of business groups based on their membership of industrial districts (as a proxy for spatial agglomeration) and to the role of spatial agglomeration and technology in vertical integration strategies. To conduct the analysis, we take advantage of a new and large data-set at firm and business group level, recently developed by ISTAT (the Italian National Statistical Institute). The data-set, referring to 2001, covers all manufacturing firms organized as joint-stock companies."

      "Das Geschäftsklima in der deutschen Leasingwirtschaft ist zwar mit seinem Rückgang seit den Sommermonaten 2007 den Abwärtsbewegungen des Stimmungsindikators der gewerblichen Wirtschaft gefolgt. Dennoch deutet sich in den Urteilen zur aktuellen Geschäftslage eine gewisse Stabilisierung an. Die aktuelle Lage wird dabei weiterhin deutlich besser beurteilt als die Aussichten für die nächsten sechs Monate. Der Investitionsfrühindikator deutet nach der kräftigen Aufwärtsbewegung im vergangenen Jahr für 2008 auf eine erkennbare Wachstumsverlangsamung bei den Ausrüstungsinvestitionen einschließlich der sonstigen Anlagen hin. Der erwartete Zuwachs wird aber noch immer bei nominal 4% liegen. Das Wachstumstempo nimmt allerdings von Quartal zu Quartal ab. Für 2009 zeichnet sich schließlich eine beginnende Investitionsschwäche ab."

This article produces evidence that suggests that these estimates are significantly upward biased. The bias arises from a general failure in the literature to control for past smoking behaviour of individuals. Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) regressions show that the smoking wage penalty is reduced by as much as a third, if past smoking of individuals is controlled for."

      "China's urban geography has been dramatically altered over the past three decades. The co-presence of splinters in urban fabric - contrasting and continuously changing in terms of condition, use, and socio-cultural consistency - is symptomatic for the country's contemporary transition, suspending existing spatial and temporal disconnections particularly on the borderland in-between old and new, poor and rich, traditional and modern. Focusing on three urban groups (long-term urban residents, rural newcomers, and urban newcomers) in a district of sociospatial diversity in Shanghai, this paper examines trajectories of urban restructuring, aspects of sociospatial identification, and elements of the person-environment-relationship."

      "Access to antiretroviral medicines (ARVs) for AIDS treatment creates a field binding local and global governance. Local modalities of AIDS treatment are governed by the context of global trade through the implementation of patents on medicines in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and within the context of global aid through development assistance. While industrialized countries, on the one hand, set aside donations to fight AIDS in developing countries, on the other hand, the same countries use the WTO to prevent developing countries from accessing cheap medicines. Uganda’s success in reducing HIV prevalence is unique among African states, and it is considered the most promising candidate for effectively “scaling up” ARV treatment on the basis of its history of dealing with the pandemic. Yet, despite the many interventions addressing HIV/AIDS and dramatic price reductions of ARVs, only a minority of the infected population is currently receiving treatment, and promises of universal coverage for all who need it seem unrealistic. Our paper examines how the disconnect between international and national priorities on the one hand, and between aid and trade on the other, are currently affecting access to ARVs in Uganda. In spite of the political discourse of equality in treatment, the realities of funding suggest the difficult choices will be made from the level of policy to that of individual. Thus, global governance of trade and of aid will both shape and rely on individuals in charge of “implementation” which must be examined outside the sanitizing context of development discourse. We introduce our use of governance in this paper, and then discuss the global governance of aid to AIDS and global governance of trade and AIDS. The second half of the paper examines the Ugandan case study beginning with a political background and examination of aids policy, followed by the history of ARV provision and advocacy for ARVs, a discussion of the national health system and then aid initiatives and trade of ARVs in Uganda. Finally, we draw preliminary conclusions from our case on the conflicts between global and local governance of trade and aid to AIDS.",
      "Adgang til Anti-retroviral (ARV) medicin til behandling af AIDS i udviklingslandene skaber nye koblinger mellem lokal og global regulering. Lokale tilgange til behandling af AIDS er reguleret dels inden for de retningslinier for patenter på medicin, der gælder i den globale regulering af handel i verdenshandelsorganisationen (WTO), og dels de reguleringsformer der eksisterer inden for international udviklingsbistand. Mens industrialiserede lande på den ene side donerer penge til bekæmpelse af AIDS i udviklingslande, sætter de samme lande begrænsninger for adgang til billig medicin gennem WTOs handelsregime. Ugandas succes i forhold til bekæmpelse af AIDS er unik blandt afrikanske stater. På basis af landets historiske tilgang til epidemien, bliver Uganda set som et godt land for opgradering af programmer til AIDS behandling. På trods af dette, de mange tiltag på AIDS området og reduktioner i prisen på AIDS medicin, er det kun en minoritet af den smittede del af befolkningen, der har adgang til AIDS medicin i dag. I dette working paper undersøger vi, hvilke konflikter der er mellem internationale og nationale prioriteter på den ene side, og mellem udviklingsbistand og international handelsregulering på den anden side, samt hvordan disse konflikter påvirker adgangen til ARV medicin i Uganda. I modsætning til den politiske diskurs om lige adgang til behandling, er international bistand forbundet med svære prioriteringer på nationalt og individuelt niveau. Derfor bliver global regulering af både handel og bistand påvirket og skabt af de individer der implementerer reguleringen nationalt. Først introducerer vi vores brug af begrebet ’governance’ (regulering), som bliver brugt i forbindelse med global regulering af udviklingsbistand og handel i relation til AIDS. I den anden halvdel af working paperet ser vi på Uganda som case: den politiske baggrund og udviklingen i Ugandas AIDS-politik, Ugandas programmer og tiltag for adgang til ARV medicin, en diskussion af det nationale sundhedssystem og endelig ARVs set i sammenhæng med handel. I konklusionen præsenterer vi ud fra casen, hvilke konflikter der kan ses i mellem globale og lokale reguleringsformer for adgang til AIDS medicin og hhv. handel og bistand til AIDS"

      "The article analyses the psychological and pedagogical problems and prospects of the distance learning of students during the pandemic period. Studies have shown that the learning process during the quarantine in the spring of 2020 was stressful for all participants in the educational process. This was caused by the lack of previous experience of distance learning and the response from the government and the number of educational problems. It is proved that the problem of insufficient universal access to the internet and the equipment necessary for training has affected both teachers and students. The current situation shows that some teachers working at higher education institutions replaced remote classes with the form of written works, which led to excessive workload of students. Such methods do not contribute to the quality of material assimilation, but on the contrary, create additional stress. It is proved that computerization affects all spheres of human activity and is an important factor in changing the quality of society life. The authors note that in order to ensure the development of higher distance education, it is necessary to improve the regulatory framework in the field of higher distance education, create a computer infrastructure, prepare software for the introduction of electronic educational platforms, as well as train and retrain teachers for conducting distance education courses. It is noted that during the process remote technologies, teachers use various forms of work with students. In particular, including Zoom classes, Skype classes, web classes, where students independently study an educational resource, perform tasks and the teacher checks it and gives a mandatory review of the completed task. The algorithm for assessing the quality of distance learning systems is justified and the use of an integral indicator with weighting coefficients is proposed, which allows us to quantify the value of local quality indicators and complex quality characteristics of distance learning systems."

      "This paper does three things. First, based on a limited number of theoretically established dimensions, it proposes a new de facto indicator for the rule of law. It is the first such indicator to take the quality of legal norms explicitly into account. Second, using this indicator we shed new light on the relationship between the rule of law and the political system of a country. Third, because political systems hardly predetermine the rule of law level of a country, we investigate the roots of the rule of law. As theory on this specific question is scarce and the rule of law is closely associated with income levels, we draw on a topical literature that deals with the fundamental causes of economic development. Our findings suggest that specific determinants of long-run development operate via the rule of law, whereas others are not related to the rule of law at all."

      "In the following paragraphs we will discuss the ?mapping of innovative clusters in national innovation systems?. For this we have used a data set of almost 3.000 firms that participated in the first and fifth survey of the Mannheimer Innovation Survey (which is comparable with CIS data). The Community Innovation Survey (CIS) is an initiative of the EU Commission and a joint survey of DG XIII/SPRINT/EIMS and Eurostat. To begin with we will, in the context of a definition of innovation systems, highlight the outline conditions for innovations in Germany, focusing above all on the basis of innovations, science and engineering. This is followed by a step-by-step empirical analysis of the mapping of innovative clusters at the company level which is based on the Community Innovation Survey set of data; and finally the structural influences (size-effect, effects of sectors/industries) on the innovative behaviour or innovative styles are presented. The explanatory power of structural influences on the innovative behaviour will also be analysed as well as the influence of other variables such as information flows and cooperation patterns within the innovation system of Germany. In the summary at the end of this paper we will suggest starting points for potential implications for innovation policy in order to be able to develop generic and specific policies for the different industry clusters. As far as we know from firms innovating at a certain level of organisation, they use a special portfolio of information and knowledge transfer strategies that can not simply be transferred to firms which are not (yet) innovative. While accepting that innovative inhouse activities are necessary to keep track with international developments and competition, a highly innovative atmosphere within the economy which supports innovative activities should be among the main goals of innovation policy. Furthermore, firms need to have an absorptive capacity to transform knowledge into innovations that bring economic success."

In the light of intensified research efforts worldwide to reduce uncertainty about the environmental impact of emissions and the cost of reducing them, this conclusion is intriguing. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, we analyze whether the result carries over to a more general setting without restriction on the number of players and which considers not only no and full learning but also partial learning. Second, we test whether the conclusion also holds if there is uncertainty about abatement costs instead of uncertainty about the benefits from global abatement. Third, we propose a transfer scheme that mitigates the possible negative effect of learning and which may even transform it into a positive effect."

      "We examine the relationship between firms' performance and credit constraints affecting export market entry. The existing research assumes that variation in firms' financial conditions identifies credit constraints. A critical assumption is that financial conditions do not affect real outcomes (performance, exporting, or investment). To relax this assumption, we focus on the direct effect of firms' fundamentals and financial conditions on firms' performance. This approach distinguishes between firms that choose not to export because it is unprofitable from firms that do not export because of binding credit constraints. Our empirical specification allows firms' characteristics to enter both the selection into exporting and return from exporting regressions. The leverage response heterogeneity identifies the presence of credit constraints. Using administrative Canadian firm-level data, our findings show that new exporters (a) increase their productivity, (b) raise their leverage ratio and (c) increase investment. We estimate that 48 percent of Canadian manufacturers face binding credit constraints when deciding whether to enter export markets. Alleviating these constraints would increase aggregate productivity by 0.97-1.04 percentage points."

      "How does macroprudential regulation affect financial stability in the presence of non-bank financial intermediaries? We estimate the contributions of traditional banks vis-'a-vis non-bank financial intermediaries to changes in systemic risk - measured as &#x2206;CoVaR - after macroprudential policy shocks in European countries. We find that while tighter macro-prudential regulation, generally, decreases systemic risk among traditional banks, it has the opposite effect on systemic risk in the non-bank financial intermediation sector. For some types of regulations, the latter effect is even stronger than the former, indicating that macro-prudential tightening increases systemic risk in the entire financial system, through leakages between the traditional and the non-bank financial intermediation sectors."

      "The European Union is currently experiencing its largest influx of asylum seekers in years. Yet the distribution of these refugees across the member states is highly uneven: Large countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain, as well as the Eastern European countries (apart from Hungary), have received relatively few asylum seekers. Far more refugees are headed to Central Europe, Sweden, and the small countries on the outskirts of the EU (Malta, Cyprus, and Bulgaria). Germany is likewise receiving an above-average number of asylum seekers: Assuming a uniform distribution across all EU countries, Germany receives three times as many in relation to its total population, and twice as many in relation to its economic strength. And now, as some of the member states are beginning to enact more restrictive refugee policies, this geographic concentration of asylum seekers is expected to increase even more. There is therefore an urgent need for the EU Member States to agree on a more uniform - and thus more fair - distribution of the refugees. In Germany, 37 percent of asylum seekers were granted protection status upon completing the asylum procedure in the first seven months of 2015. According to available data, however, the integration of these refugees into the German labor market has presented numerous difficulties. The number of unemployed individuals - which was initially low - has increased among the members of the most frequently represented refugee nationalities. Among all Syrians living in Germany with a residence permit, for example, there are more unemployed individuals than there are social security- paying employed individuals. The ratio is only slightly better for people from Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, and Eritrea. Accordingly, the proportion of Hartz IV benefits recipients among these groups is high. It is assumed that these problems are significantly mitigated the longer the recognized refugees remain in Germany and the greater command they have over the German language. The study of German should therefore be better supported."

      "Labor force outcomes after an involuntary job loss tend to differ systematically between men and women, with women experiencing a lower probability of finding another job, a longer average duration of nonemployment, and larger losses in hours given reemployment. This study examines the role of family structure in such sex differences in postdisplacement outcomes. Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics indicate that unmarried women have postdisplacement outcomes similar to men whereas married women’s outcomes differ considerably from those of men. The presence of children in the household appears to partially account for sex differences in postdisplacement outcomes, with women with young children less likely to be reemployed and more likely to not be in the labor force than their childless counterparts and than men."

      "In developing countries, a large share of employees work informally and are not covered by employment protection legislation. I study here how gender wage inequality differs across formal and informal jobs in Brazil. The raw gender wage gap is higher in informal jobs (13%) compared to formal jobs (5%), but I show that this difference is an artefact of different male and female selection processes. First, women have better observable characteristics than men and the female advantage is stronger among formal employees. Second, men and women entering formal and informal jobs have different unobservable characteristics. Controlling for endogenous selection into formal vs. informal jobs, I find that the gender gap in wage offers is high and increases with education in formal jobs. In informal jobs, however, estimated wage offers are the same for men and women. I discuss the potential implications of these findings regarding the effect of labour market regulation on gender wage gaps."

      "The purpose of this conceptual article is to demonstrate that Donald Schön's Reflective Practitioner actually outlines an explicit model of the steps that project leaders in practice apply largely unaware. This reflective research model furthermore can be meaningfully combined with Argyris and Schön's model of organizational learning. The combined research and learning model can support project team members and leaders to enhance their reflectiveness and improve their project success. Eighteen project leaders of innovation teams were studied by means of in-depth interviews aimed at assessing how project leaders act when dealing with critical incidents during their projects. Based on a selection of three project leaders, an empirical illustration of Schön's model is provided: they recognized there was a problem, researched the problem, developed alternative solutions, tested different solutions and alternatives on validity, tried out and experimented with solutions, selected and applied a particular solution, and evaluated the process completed. The authors' suggestion for practitioners is applying the combined model of the reflective practitioner and organizational learning, as this can help innovation leadership in practice at both the individual and the team level. The scientific value of this contribution lies in the conversion of Schön's latent (tacit) model into a manifest (explicit) model, and by relating it to the model of organizational learning, a result emerges that is both applicable to future research and practice."

      "We investigate regional differences in the level and the development of regional new business formation activity. There is a pronounced variance of start-up rates across the regions. The level of regional new firm formation is rather pathdependent so that changes are relatively small. The main factors determining the level of regional start-ups are innovation and entrepreneurship. These factors also seem to be responsible for changes in the level of regional new business formation. In addition, unemployment plays a role. Steering innovation and creating an entrepreneurial atmosphere could be an appropriate starting point for policy measures that try to promote start-ups. Our empirical evidence strongly suggests that such measures may have significant effect only in the long run.",
      "Wir analysieren regionale Unterschiede des Niveaus von Gründungsaktivitäten und dessen Entwicklung. Die regionalen Gründungsraten weisen eine ausgeprägte Streuung auf. Dabei ist eine deutliche Pfadabhängigkeit der Gründungsaktivitäten feststellbar, so dass Änderungen relativ gering ausfallen. Die wesentlichen Bestimmungsgründe für das Niveau der Gründungsaktivitäten sind Innovation und Unternehmertum. Diese Faktoren spielen auch für Veränderungen der regionalen Gründungsaktivitäten eine Rolle. Zusätzlich hat hier auch das Niveau der regionalen Arbeitslosigkeit einen Einfluss. Die Stimulierung von Innovationsaktivitäten und von Entrepreneurship stellen geeignete Ansatzpunkte für eine Politik dar, die auf eine Steigerung der Gründungsaktivitäten abzielt. Unser empirischer Befund weist allerdings darauf hin, dass ein wesentlicher Effekt solcher Maßnahmen erst längerfristig erwartet werden kann."

      "We use the panel data of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and of the Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (ULMS) to investigate whether risk attitudes have primary (exogenous) determinants that are valid in different stages of economic development and in a different structural context, comparing a mature capitalist economy and a transition economy. We then analyze the stability of the risk measures over time. Between 2007 and 2012 we have the Great Recession, which had a mild impact in the German labor market while it had a more profound impact on the Ukrainian labor market. This enables us to investigate whether and how the crisis impacted on the risk attitudes in the two countries. By focusing on self-employment we also investigate whether the reduced willingness to take risks as a consequence of the Great Recession affects labor market dynamics and outcomes."

      "This paper primarily explores the relevance of Corporate Social Responsibility Practices (CSRP) of organizations in attracting university students (prospective employees) in developing countries. The study employed a survey strategy, where questionnaires were administered to 600 final-year undergraduate students at the premier Business School in Ghana out of which 500 were returned. Though results show relatively low level of CSR awareness, the respondents agreed that the elements of an organisation's CSRP, whether economic, social or environmental, played a determining role in their preference for a particular organisation (employer). Also, the disclosure of CSRP by an organisation is relevant in their choice of an employer. The findings suggest the need for organisations to take cognizance of the growing interest of prospective employees in working for organisations that engage in CSR activities and disclosures. Furthermore, educational institutions must be deliberate in developing CSR orientation of students to engage in the systematic processing of CSR related information through Education for Sustainable Development (ESD)."

      "Sustainable economic growth requires financial sector development. However, financial development is low in Ethiopia. Hence, the main objective of the study was to examine determinants of financial development in Ethiopia. Annual data from 1980 to 2019 was used and examined by ARDL estimation technique. Private sector credit and money supply as percentage of GDP were used as dependent variables. Independent variables include external debt, reserve requirement, real exchange rate, lending interest rate, inflation, political freedom index, trade openness and economic growth. Broad money supply model is positively affected by political freedom index, economic growth and trade openness both in the short run and long run. While it is negatively affected by interest rate and reserve requirement. However, real exchange rate has negative effect in the long run and insignificant effect in the short run. On the other hand, credit to private sector model is positively affected by inflation, and political freedom, economic growth and trade openness. While it is negatively affected by external debt, reserve requirement and lending interest rate. Error correction estimation result of credit to private sector model shows the adjustment coefficient is -0.263 and statistically significant at 5% level of significance, which means short run deviation from long run equilibrium is adjusted at a rate of 26.3%. The adjustment coefficient for broad money supply model is -0.254. The study recommends that the government needs to improve trade and the quality of factors of production, reduce reserve requirement, reducing interest rate on lending, political."

      "We study potential impacts of future climate change on U.S. agricultural productivity using county-level yield and weather data from 1950 to 2015. To account for adaptation of production to different weather conditions, it is crucial to allow for both spatial and temporal variation in the production process mapping weather to crop yields. We present a new panel data estimation technique, called mean observation OLS (MO-OLS) that allows for spatial and temporal heterogeneity in all regression parameters (intercepts and slopes). Both forms of heterogeneity are important: We find strong evidence that production function parameters adapt to local climate, and also that sensitivity of yield to high temperature declined from 1950-89. We use our estimates to project corn yields to 2100 using 19 climate models and three greenhouse gas emission scenarios. We predict unmitigated climate change will greatly reduce yield. Our mean prediction (over climate models) is that adaptation alone can mitigate 36% of the damage, while emissions reductions consistent with the Paris targets would mitigate 76%."

      "The paper aims at understanding the structural features of the bargaining coalitions in the Doha Round of the WTO. We provide an empirical assessment of the preferences of each negotiating actor looking at general economics indicators, development levels, structure of the agricultural sectors, and trade policies for agricultural products. Bargaining coalitions are analyzed by grouping countries through a cluster analysis procedure. The clusters are compared with existing coalitions, in order to assess their degree of internal homogeneity as well as their common interests. Such a comparison allows the detection of possible \"defectors\", i.e. countries that according to their economic conditions and policies seem to be relatively less committed to the positions of the coalition they join."

      "As developing countries rapidly urbanize, the number of people living in 'slums'-neighbourhoods lacking property rights and basic services-continues to increase. Whether slum residents will ultimately share in the benefits of the cities they help build or will remain trapped in poverty is not well understood. We review empirical evidence on the potential for social mobility in today's urban slums in order to assess prospects for upward mobility in cities of the Global South. Finding evidence for limited levels of upward mobility and high levels of volatility, we discuss the substantial public sector interventions that accompanied urbanization in the Global North. We argue that urbanization will not automatically improve prospects for mobility for the urban poor. Instead, it will be critical to implement appropriately nuanced interventions to improve opportunities for the billions residing in today's and tomorrow's slums."

      "Inventions depend on skills, experience, and information exchange. Information is shared among individuals and organizations both intentionally and unintentionally. Unintentional flows of knowledge, or knowledge spillovers, are viewed as an integral element of technological progress. However, little is known about the overall patterns of knowledge flows across technology sectors or over long periods of time. This paper explores whether it is possible to identify “invention machines” – technologies that help create new inventions in a wide range of other sectors – and whether shifts in the patterns of knowledge flows can predict future technological change. In the spirit of big data we analyze the entire PatStat database of 90 million published patents from 160 patent offices over a century of invention and exploit variation within and across countries and technology fields over time. The direction and intensity of knowledge spillovers measured from prior-art citations highlight the transition from mechanical to electrical instruments, especially industrial control systems, and the rise of information and communication technologies as “invention machines” after 1970. Most recently, the rapidly increasing impact of digital communications on other fields may herald the emergence of cloud computing and the industrial internet as the new dominant industrial paradigm."

      "In this paper we investigate whether the extension of the entitlement to unemployment benefits in the mid 80s can explain the increase in the unemployment rates of unskilled and elder workers in western Germany. To answer this question we estimate a version of the Burdett-Mortensen search equilibrium model and analyze how workers? search behaviour responded to these reforms. We try both nonparametric and fully-parametric estimation methods and identify the cases in which the nonparametric approach cannot be applied. We find that the entitlement reforms are largely responsible for the increase of unemployment among unskilled workers."

      "This study assesses the role of ICT in modulating the impact of education and lifelong learning on income inequality and economic growth. It focuses on a sample of 48 African countries from 2004 to 2014. The empirical evidence is based on the generalised method of moments (GMM). The following findings are established. First, mobile phone and internet each interact with primary school education to decrease income inequality. Second, all ICT indicators interact with secondary school education to exert a negative impact on the Gini index. Third, fixed broadband distinctly interacts with primary school education and lifelong learning to have a positive effect on economic growth. Fourth, ICT indicators do not significantly influence inequality and economic growth through tertiary school education and lifelong learning. These main findings are further substantiated. Policy implications are discussed."

      "According to Saskia Sassen (2012), contemporary borders are not erected against other sovereigns, but against nonstate transnational actors, migrants among them. The autonomy of migration of the latter is an act of resistance against the border regimes. Border and immigration controls aim at detecting and disciplining individuals, whose mobility questions state sovereignty. As Walters (2002) and De Genova (2010) notice, deportation and their sheer possibility, or deportability of migrants, produce sovereignty in the face of uncontrolled border-crossings, perceived by the states as a disturbing symptom of 'losing control.' The paper dialectically joins the theories concerning the macrolevel (state sovereignty, capitalist system relying on the immigrant labor force) and the level micro (the individual experience of deportation). The author presents the types of violence they experienced throughout the process of deportation. The analyzed ethnographic material is an outcome of the fieldwork conducted between 2012 and 2014 in the pueblo San Ángel in Lower Mixteca in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. Qualitative interviews with 27 inhabitants of pueblo who were deported from the US between 2006 and 2012 are the basis of the analysis. Deportation was an experience of the US state for this women and men who attempted to remain 'in the shadows.' The article presents the analysis of the phases of deportation (detection, detention, immigration court, transfer and return to Mexico) and the types of violence experienced. It is necessary to include also types of violence other than the physical, among them the objective types of violence: (éZiézek 2010): the structural (Galtung 1969) and the symbolic (Bourdieu, Wacquant 2001). The author demonstrates that symbolic violence can lead to resigning from appealing against the deportation order. The author describes how violence used against migrants reconstructs the US sovereignty in lieu of 'the shadows' where the migrants lived."

      "We study the possibility for international diversification of catastrophe risk by the insurance sector. Adopting the argument that large insurance losses may be a `globalizing factor' for the industry, we study the dependence of geographically distant insurance markets via equity returns. In particular, we employ conditional copula theory to model the bivariate dependence of the insurance industry. In contrast to earlier literature on this subject, we disentangle the causes of dependence stemming from the asset side from those from the liability side by conditioning on general market conditions. We find that for both Europe--America and Europe--Asia the dependence is significant. Moreover, we find asymmetric effects: the international dependence is particularly high for losses, even after conditioning for the asset side dependence. Finally, we investigate the time variation in copula parameters and find evidence that dependence in the insurance sector has increased over time, thus reducing the scope for international diversification of large losses in this sector."

      "We suggest an alternative approach to testing whether stocks provide a hedge against inflation in the long run. Based on a simple structural model, we test the hedge hypothesis in terms of the long-run linkage between stock prices and the general price level, as estimated by cointegration analysis. Using data for the Danish stock market over the post-World War II-period, results give strong support for the hedge property, defined in the narrow sense of a perfect hedge. This contrasts with the weak support found in the literature and also represents stronger support than produced by standard methods. We argue that our approach has the advantage of allowing for a clear distinction between short- and long-run dynamics of stock prices which adjust slowly to long-run equilibrium."

      "Background: Post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) pose a high burden for individuals and societies. Although prevalence rates are rather low, high co-occurrence rates and overall impairments cause deleterious suffering and significant costs. Still, no long-term data on costs and trends in cost developments are available. Methods Claims data from a German research database were analysed regarding direct and indirect costs occurring for individuals with incident diagnoses of PTSD. Results were compared to non-exposed average insurants matched on age and gender. Costs were analysed over a 5-year period from 2 years preceding until 3 years following an incident diagnosis of PTSD. Results Overall costs for PTSD account for approximately 43,000 EUR per individual, which is three times higher than costs for non-exposed controls. Of these costs, 59% are caused by mental disorders, 18% specifically by PTSD. In the control group, costs for mental disorders account for 19% of total costs. Costs increase by 142% in the year after an incident diagnosis of PTSD but return to the initial level 2 years later. Still, costs are at least twice as high in every year as in those for the comparison group. Conclusions Individuals with PTSD seem to suffer from far more impairments in their general health conditions and incur many more costs than average insurants. Most of these seem to be caused by co-occurring mental disorders and show their maximum in the index year. Nevertheless, as costs decrease to their initial level, treatments seem to have counterbalanced the impairments due to PTSD. Thus, treatments for PTSD can be considered as beneficial and their cost-effectiveness should be further investigated."

      "This paper empirically assesses the impact of the intensity of competition on investment in new technologies within the mobile telecommunications industry. Using firm level panel data and an instrumental variable estimation it finds an inverted-U relationship between competition intensity and investment. The intermediate level of competition intensity that maximizes investment stands at 62 percent, whereby competition intensity is measured by 1-Lerner index at the firm level. This means that the maximal level of investment is reached, on average, when the operating pro t represents 38 percent of total revenue. This result is rationalized through a theoretical model that yields an inverted-U relationship between competition and investment. It shows that the potential technological progress, measured by the impact of investment on the reduction of marginal cost, is the main determinant of the investment maximizing intermediate level of competition. The higher the potential technological progress, the lower the level of competition intensity that maximizes investment"

      "In order to investigate firm survival and the potential for competition in the German postal market, I analyzed key success determinants of market leader competitors. The analysis is based on eight 2011 case studies, in which I conducted in-depth interviews during on-site visits to various postal firms. The analysis is further supported by unique data stemming from a survey I conducted in 2010 for the German postal market. In general, I find that there are possibilities for smaller private firms to succeed and survive in the market despite the natural monopoly occurring within the postal industry. The success of these firms is often based on specialization, cooperation and combining the postal business with another business, such as publishing."

      "This paper experimentally studies the disposition effects of teams and individuals. The disposition effect describes the phenomenon that investors are reluctant to realize losses, whereas winners are sold too early. Our experiments compare the investments of two-person teams to a setting where investors trade alone. We find that subjects investing jointly exhibit more pronounced disposition effects than individuals. A closer look reveals that investor teams hardly realize losses and predominately sell winners. The data suggest that decision-dependent emotions may explain the differences. That is, teams reporting high levels of regret exhibit significantly higher disposition effects than individuals."

      "The lack of portfolio granularity in terms of exposure has been shown to have important implications for the amount of a financial institution’s economic capital. Based on a numerical simulation model, we provide concrete examples of how granularity affects capital levels. We achieve this by following two simulation approaches, including a dynamic setup as a more realistic version of the analysis. We show that granularity has an indirect effect on the expected loss component. This could lead to significant changes in the competitive environment should banks consider adding a granularity adjustment to the estimated amount of capital and account for it in their pricing."

      "Research papers that studied the Triple Helix in relation to international co-authorship considered international collaboration as the fourth element of the system. This paper suggests considering three levels of study to assess the effect of international collaboration on an innovation system: the domestic one, the foreign one and the global one. The mutual information and the transmission power are used as indicators. Bibliographic data of South Korea and the West African region for a 10-year period (2001-2010) were downloaded and imported to a bibliographic software application. Searches are run to determine the Triple Helix actors and their bi- or trilateral collaboration contributions per considered area, year and level. Then, the mutual information and the transmission power were computed. Results show that at the domestic level, the South Korean innovation system is more integrated, whereas the West African one is less integrated than that of their partners. Results also show that international collaboration has strengthened knowledge sharing at the domestic level for both South Korea and West Africa, but to a different extent; in other words, the two areas have benefited from international collaboration in terms of knowledge flow."

      "Labour market segmentation in developing countries has been considered in a growing literature, some of which suggests an informal sector wage premium. However, such studies have mainly focused on urban labour markets and have not discriminated between the informally self-employed and wage workers. This paper examines segmentation in rural markets for agricultural wage workers in Ethiopia, controlling for location, farming systems and observed worker characteristics. Applying an endogenous switching model with simultaneous estimation of wage equations it establishes an informal sector wage premium, self-selection into the informal sector and sectorally-distinct wage determination mechanisms."

      "This paper studies the individual-level relationship between immigration and property crime in England and Wales using crime self-reports from the Crime and Justice Survey. Models that account for underreporting are used, since this is a major concern in crime self-reports. The results indicate that the reported crime is substantially underreported, but if anything, immigrants are less likely to underreport than natives. More importantly, controlling for underreporting and basic demographics, the estimates across all model specifications, although imprecise, indicate that immigration status and property crime are negatively associated. We finally find that the estimated relationship between immigration status and property crime differs across regions and ethnic groups."

      "Economic sanctions are intensively used by international institutions to enforce political objectives. Since 2006 the EU has been implementing general sanctions against the whole economy of Iran, affecting their trade relations. Since 2007, and following the imposition of sanctions by the UN Security Council, the EU has also implemented smart sanctions targeting Iranian entities and natural persons associated with its military activities. In a non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL), this paper investigates the impact of general and targeted EU sanctions against Iran on quarterly bilateral trade values between the 19 members of the euro area (EA19) and Iran between the first quarter of 1999 and the fourth quarter of 2018. The results indicate that general sanctions have strongly hampered trade flows between the two trading partners. The impact of general sanctions on the total imports of the EA19 from Iran is more than four times stronger than on the total exports of the EA19 to Iran. Moreover, the EU's general sanctions have hampered trade in almost all sectors, except for the primary sectors. Furthermore, our study finds that the impact of smart sanctions targeting Iranian entities and natural persons is much smaller than the impact of general sanctions on total trade values and the trade values of many sectors. Smart sanctions affect the exports of most sectors from the EA19 to Iran, while they are statistically insignificant for the imports of many sectors from Iran. Thus, this paper provides evidence on the motivations behind smart sanctions, which target specific individuals and entities rather than the whole economy, unlike general sanctions, which have a negative impact on ordinary people."

      "Intuitive competence is an important human characteristic. This article discusses the importance of human intuition in the context of creating new knowledge. In particular, inspirational intuition plays an important role. In contrast, to Daniel Kahneman's fast, intuitive, and routine decision making in terms of a \"System 1\" (Kahneman 2011, pp. 19 ff.), inspirational intuition is shown to be a slow, incubational, and illuminative force. As a new \"System 3\", it forms an important core human capability to enable unprecedented knowledge with the help of original intuitions. The scientific paper shows the development of a helpful questionnaire to quantify inspirational intuition. This managerial approach captures individual differences in the potential of inspirational knowledge imagination and helps the management better realize and operationalize this intuitive competence in the competition of best ideas.",

      "We show how differences in demand and unbalanced call flows affect considerably the pricing strategies of competing telecommunications networks and this both for competition in linear and nonlinear pricing. Differences in demand give also scope for targeted entry. If networks are close substitutes, we show that an incumbent is able to deter such targeted entry on a customer segment which tends to have a net outflow of calls, though this is harder in nonlinear than in linear pricing.",
      "In dem Aufsatz wird gezeigt, wie Unterschiede in der Nachfrage und ungleichgewichtige Folgen von Telefonanrufen die Preisstrategien der im Wettbewerb stehenden Anbieter von Telekommunikationsnetzen beeinflussen. Dies gilt für den linearen und nichtlinearen Preiswettbewerb. Unterschiede in der Nachfrage schaffen auch einen Spielraum für bewußte Markteintritte. Wenn Netze enge Substitute sind, dann kann gezeigt werden, daß die eingesessenen Netzanbieter im Stande sind, derartige Markteintritte in Kundensegmente zu verhindern, die durch einen Nettoüberschuß an herausgehenden Anrufen gekennzeichnet sind. Dies ist jedoch bei nichtlinearer Preispolitik schwieriger als bei linearer Preispolitik."

      "Growth that reduces poverty is often considered pro-poor regardless of whether the poor benefit from it more than the non-poor. Such growth could simply be termed poverty-reducing growth. This paper argues that for growth to be pro-poor it should disproportionally benefit the poor. The paper proposes an operational definition of pro-poor growth that restricts it to the cases in which the mean income of the poor increases proportionally more than that of the non-poor. A new index is proposed based exclusively on the redistributional component of poverty-gap changes obtained through an exact decomposition. It is then shown that this component measures how pro-poor growth is over a given period based on the above mentioned definition. The paper further presents several indicators for evaluating and monitoring the 'pro-poorness' of growth over time and concludes with an empirical illustration for the case of Honduras."

      "While the Guatemalan Truth Commission came to the conclusion that agents of the state had committed acts of genocide in the early 1980s, fundamental questions remain. Should we indeed speak of the massacres committed between 1981 and 1983 in Guatemala as 'genocide', or would 'ethnocide' be the more appropriate term? In addressing these questions, this paper focuses on the intentions of the perpetrators. Why did the Guatemalan military chose mass murder as the means to 'solve the problem of subversion'? In Guatemala, the discourses of communist threat, racism and Pentecostal millenarism merged into the intent to destroy the Mayan population. This paper demonstrates that the initial policy of physical annihilation (genocidal option) was transformed into a policy of restructuring the sociocultural patterns of the Guatemalan highlands (ethnocidal option).",
      "Auch wenn die guatemaltekische 'Wahrheitskommission' festgestellt hat, dass die Massaker in den frühen 1980er Jahren genozidale Ausmaße hatten, bleiben fundamentale Fragen umstritten: Ist der adäquate Begriff für die zwischen 1981 und 1983 begangenen Massaker tatsächlich 'Genozid' oder lassen sie sich eher als 'Ethnozid' begreifen? Um diese Fragen zu beantworten, konzentriert sich dieser Beitrag auf die Intentionen der Täter. Warum griff das guatemaltekische Militär auf Massenmord zurück, um das 'Problem der Subversion' zu lösen? In Guatemala verschmolzen antikommunistische, rassistische und millenaristische Diskurse zu einer Politik, die auf die Vernichtung der Maya-Bevölkerung zu abzielte. Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird beschrieben, wie eine genozidale Option, die auf die physische Vernichtung der Maya-Bevölkerung abzielte, zu einer ethnozidalen Option wurde: Ziel der Terrorstrategie war nunmehr die indirekte Vernichtung durch die soziokulturelle Neuordnung des guatemaltekischen Hochlandes."

      "The role of financial technology companies increases every day. From one side this process generates more possibilities for consumers from other side it is related with new risks which arise in banking sector. At the beginning of FinTech era lots of analyst were discussing about disruptive potential in financial services. Later, however, we can see more discussions about cooperation between FinTech companies and banks. The other point which is very important to discuss about is a financial inclusion. The purpose of this study is to analyze the interaction between banking sector and FinTech companies. We use a case study of Lithuania because here FinTech sector is growing very intensively. First of all we try to analyze the scientific literature which analyzes the main aspects of FinTech sector. The second part of the article provides the progress of the FinTech sector and presents the main points of methodology. The research of the FinTech sector in Lithuania was focused on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) and political, economic, social, technological, environmental, legal (PESTEL) analysis and main statistical parameters. We also used a correlation and regression analysis together with qualitative assessments. Our results showed that in order to value the interaction between banking and financial technology better to focus on qualitative assessment because only statistical analysis can give different and wrong results. We identified that both sectors interact with each other and there is no a disruptive effect of FinTech in Lithuania."

      "In dieser Studie argumentieren wir für einen \"Big Push\" bei den Infrastrukturinvestitionen im größeren Europa. Wir schlagen den Bau einer \"Europäischen Seidenstraße\" vor, welche die industriellen Zentren im Westen mit den bevölkerungsreichen, aber weniger entwickelten Gebieten im Osten des Kontinents verbinden und damit für mehr Wachstum und Beschäftigung sowohl kurz- als auch mittel- und langfristig sorgen soll. Im Vollausbau soll die \"Europäische Seidenstraße\" auf dem Landweg rund 11.000 Kilometer auf einer Nordroute von Lissabon bis Uralsk an der russisch-kasachischen Grenze und auf einer Südroute von Mailand bis nach Wolgograd und Baku verlaufen. Kernstücke sind im Norden die Strecke von Lyon bis Moskau und im Süden von Mailand bis Konstanza. Die Südroute würde Mitteleuropa mit dem Schwarzmeerraum und den Anrainerstaaten des Kaspischen Meeres verbinden. Eine moderne Autobahn- und Hochgeschwindigkeitszugstrecke mit einer Reihe von Logistikzentren, See-, Fluss- und Flughäfen soll neue europäische Standards unter anderem in der E-Mobilität setzen. Der Vollausbau würde rund 1.000 Milliarden Euro oder rund 8% des Bruttoinlandsproduktes der auf den beiden Routen liegenden Länder ausmachen. Die Kosten relativ zur Wirtschaftsleistung der EU machen rund 7% aus. Über einen Investitionszeitraum von 10 Jahren könnte die \"Europäische Seidenstraße\" entlang der Routen nach einer konservativen Schätzung zu einem Wirtschaftswachstum von durchschnittlich 3,5% und einem Anstieg der Beschäftigung von rund 2 Millionen führen. Unter günstigen Umständen und bei weiterhin anhaltenden niedrigen Zinsen kann mit einem Beschäftigungseffekt von über 7 Millionen im größeren Europa gerechnet werden. Alleine auf der Nordroute in den russischen Zentralraum könnte die verbesserte Infrastruktur der Kernstrecke bedeutende Zeitersparnisse von über 8% im Straßentransport bringen. Das wäre im Schnitt und beispielsweise auch ab Wien eine Ersparnis von rund 2,5 Stunden. Damit könnten die Länder entlang der Nordroute ihre Exporte nach Russland um über 11% steigern. Dies würde zusätzliche Exporte von über 12,5 Milliarden Euro bedeuten. Die österreichische Exportwirtschaft würde ganz besonders von diesen Infrastrukturmaßnahmen profitieren. Österreichs Russland-Exporte würden um über 14% ansteigen. Das sind rund 330 Millionen Euro. Die Baumaßnahmen bringen Österreich 34.000 Arbeitsplätze. Unter günstigen Umständen könnten bis zu 121.000 neue Jobs in Österreich geschaffen werden.",
      "The study concludes that Europe should respond to China's New Silk Road initiative with a coherent infrastructure network and transport strategy of its own to leverage its economic potential. It should not rely on China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to achieve this, but invest itself to ensure that it suits European priorities. Nevertheless, a 'European Silk Road' can be seen as complementary to China's efforts. The study finds that the development of a European Silk Road could create 2-7 million new jobs and could increase GDP on average by 3.5% in Wider Europe over a ten-year period. Eastern Europe in particular needs an upgrading of its transport infrastructure. If this is achieved, the boost to incomes and living standards would be particularly significant in that part of the continent, as a 'big push' in transport infrastructure investment has the potential to industrialise broad sectors of the economy."

      "This paper analyzes the dynamic effects of different macroeconomic shocks on unemployment in Germany. In a first step, a cointegration analysis of productivity, prices, real wages, employment, and the unemployment rate reveals two long run relationships, interpreted as a labor demand and a wage setting scheme. Secondly, a structural VAR model is identified using the restrictions suggested by a single macroeconomic model. The impulse response analysis and the forecast error variance decomposition display that price, demand, and labor supply shocks affect unemployment significantly in the short/medium run. Interestingly, however, wage and technology shocks do not seem to play a dominant role."

      "The development of higher education (HE) in sub-Saharan Africa has presented contradictory features and outcomes over the past two decades. On the one hand, the number of public and private HE institutions has increased in the present era of massification (where HE environments have reached almost universal access). This led to a diversification of academic programmes on offer, and enrolments surged to the point that sub-Saharan Africa experienced the fastest growth of all UNESCO world regions over the period. Yet on the other hand, gross enrolment rates (less than 10 percent on average in the region) remain by far the lowest and show slower progression than in other parts of the global South, as the rise in the number of institutions and in enrolment has not kept pace with population growth and increased social demand for higher education. These contradictions between dynamics typically associated with massified HE environments and features of highly elitist systems beg a closer examination of this process of expansion and diversification, and more specifically of how it has affected different socio-economic groups. Drawing on secondary data and policy material, and using three national contexts as case studies (Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal), the paper highlights how issues of inequalities and inequity in access to and participation in higher education were addressed by national policies in contexts of expansion and diversification. It then examines how the HE opportunities resulting from the expansion generated new inequalities at the levels of access to HE institutions and programmes, in student experience and in access to labour markets and social recognition. The case study perspective reveals how the relationship between growth and other dimensions of national HE developments are both context-contingent and shaped, or exacerbated by, international pressures. It allows a better understanding of the common challenges of African HE systems in terms of access \"for whom?\" \"to what?\" and \"what for?\" while avoiding excessive generalizations in conclusions and suggestions."

      "The concept of surveillance is vital for a digital era, especially considering that the term surveillance is several centuries old. It has been modified over time to fit new circumstances. Today, when surveillance has become part of the very infrastructure of contemporary societies, the task of understanding and updating the concept of surveillance is more important than ever. Here, the concept is defined, traced over time, elaborated upon and its current uses discussed. It is shown to be a multi-disciplinary concept, one that requires multi-faceted understanding. Today, the ubiquitous use of smart phones - a key surveillance-enabling device - and the data-analysing capacities of large organisations, public and private, means that the concept has an ongoing life and impact. It is an analytical concept but also a contested and critical one, required for understanding and engaging with our times."

      "This paper argues that the so-called Arab spring is part of a tectonic shift which signals the frailty of the Arab state system as such. Countries benefitting from oil and gas rents have been more resilient, because of their potential to create systems of incentives and disincentives in order to prevent disruptive social change. Islamism, whose emergence is connected with rentier state dynamics is, at the same time, an opportunity and a threat for the survival of the Arab state and, in general, of the Arab states system. In this context, national oil companies can increasingly be conceptualized not merely as instruments of the state, but as bulwarks of nation-state legitimacy in a period of chaos."

      "The Australian government will double its Official Development Assistance by 2015 (over 2010 levels). Innovative delivery mechanisms will be required to ensure aid is spent efficiently. In addition to traditional delivery mechanisms - bilateral, multilateral - the Australian government has piloted a small partnership activity with churches in the Pacific. The Church Partnerships Programme is premised on the realization that in certain Pacific countries, the churches have existing, functioning and well-regarded national networks and close links with local communities that are suitable conduits for donor funding. In this sense they are ideal partners for the delivery of effective aid. This paper will consider this model and the benefit it brings. There are of course consequences for both the churches and their communities for this influx of aid money and changing activities and these will be briefly considered. Finally, extending this partnership model to non-Christian religious faiths in other countries, such as Islamic nationwide organizations in Indonesia, is also discussed."

      "Der anhaltende Krieg in der Ukraine hat die Energiepreise im März 2022 auf Höchststände getrieben und die bereits durch die Pandemie stark gesteigerten Nahrungsmittelpreise emporschnellen lassen. In Deutschland machen Nahrungsmittel durchschnittlich nur rund 10 % der Konsumausgaben aus und die globalen Agrarrohstoffpreise sind ein relativ geringer Bestandteil der Lebensmittelpreise. Aber auch hier belasten die um 5,9 % verteuerten Nahrungsmittel einschließlich alkoholfreier Getränke die Haushalte mit geringeren Einkommen. Deutlich stärker schlagen allerdings weiterhin die Preise für Energie zu Buche: 4 Prozentpunkte der Inflationsrate in Höhe von 7,3 % im März 2022 sind den Preisen für Haushaltsenergie sowie für Kraft- und Schmierstoffe geschuldet. Die Spanne der aktuellen haushaltsspezifischen Inflationsraten beträgt 1,9 Prozentpunkte. Sie reicht von 6 % für einkommensstarke Alleinlebende bis 7,9 % für einkommensschwache vierköpfige Familien. Noch ausgeprägter ist der Unterschied zwischen der kombinierten Belastung durch die Preise von Nahrungsmitteln, Haushaltsenergie und Kraftstoffen mit 2,6 Prozentpunkten, wobei einkommensschwache Familien einen Inflationsbeitrag von 5,9 Prozentpunkten verzeichnen, verglichen mit 3,3 Prozentpunkten im Falle von einkommensstarken Alleinlebenden. Im März 2022 erreichte die Inflationsrate dem Basisprognoseszenario des IMK zufolge ihren Höhepunkt. Die Zusatzbelastung durch die Preisschübe bei Energie und Nahrungsmitteln betrug im ersten Quartal 2022 271 Euro für eine vierköpfige Familie mit geringem Einkommen und 84 Euro für einkommensarme Alleinlebende. Die beiden von der Regierung auf den Weg gebrachten Entlastungspakete dürften die Zusatzbelastungen relativ sozial ausgewogen zu einem erheblichen Teil abdecken."

      "This paper investigates some of the existing hypotheses regarding the transmission of different colonial legacies to modern day economic growth. The fact that different colonial strategies were pursued by different colonizers in various territories suggests possible ramifications for current development paths. This paper attempts to understand why economic growth performance is different even among African countries, where former British colonies appear to do marginally better. It focuses on two key channels of transmission, namely education and trade. Thirty-six Sub-Saharan African countries during the period 1960 - 2000 are considered using Hausman-Taylor estimation techniquein an annualized panel data framework. In contrast with the methodology of previous studieswhere only the initial conditions at independence were held to influence the post-colonialgrowth path, this study attempts to distinguish the direct influences of colonization from the indirect influences by combining both the initial conditions at independence alongside the subsequent post-independence changes in explaining growth differences amongst former Sub-Saharan African colonies.The results suggest that the indirect influences of colonial educational policies matter more for post-colonial growth than the direct influences."

      "According to housing investment models, house prices and replacement cost should have an equilibrating relationship. Previous empirical work - mainly based on aggregate-level data - has found only little evidence of such a relationship. By using a unique data set, covering transactions of single-family houses over a 25 years period, we establish strong support for the relationship at the micro level. In the time series context, we find that new house prices and replacement cost align quickly after a shock. In the cross-sectional context, we find prices of old houses and replacement cost are closely related once building depreciation has been taken into account. As to be expected from these results, replacement cost information also proves to be useful for the prediction of future house prices."

It will examine the role of complementary reforms in government administration and policies. The focus is chiefly on the rural economy, where the developmental needs are the greatest, and the use of ICTs presents the most challenges. It examines the nature of benefits in areas such as education, health, market efficiency, and democratic participation, the channels through which impacts can be realized, and the practical means for realizing potential benefits, including organizational innovations and government policy as well as structural changes."

The way in which the two will cooperate in the context of the Crimean crisis and in other issues related to the Eastern European space is very important not only for them, but also for the other countries, which are find themselves at the confluence between them, such as the Republic of Moldova. The role of the Republic of Moldova in securing stability and peace in the region is growing, and with it, the responsibility of the Moldovan authorities to manage their relations with the great powers is growing as well. The study aims to present the effect which the relations between Moldova and the great powers have on its economy and future political perspectives and their evolution in the context of recent events."

      "With the availability of new techniques to close wine bottles avoiding the risk of “corky” taste the tradition of closing wine bottles with cork stoppers is on the retreat. As a consequence the Mediterranean cork oak forests with their rich biodiversity are endangered since their cultivation is not profitable anymore. This paper explores the viability of a market approach to the preservation of these ecologically valuable landscapes. In an internet-based Contingent Valuation survey we assess wine consumers' willingness to pay a higher price for wine bottles closed with high-quality cork stoppers instead of buying wine with alternative stoppers in order to preserve the cork oak landscapes. We find that though many wine consumers have experience with tainted wine they are, nevertheless, willing to buy wine with (highquality) cork stoppers at higher prices. Their average WTP is, however, not sufficient to cover the additional costs of these stoppers. Thus, we propose a financing mix of market returns and government subsidies for preserving the cork oaks. As a precondition for this market approach to be successful bottles with high-quality cork stoppers must be clearly identifiable in the shops, and consumers must be informed about the ecological consequences of supporting the cork production."

      "Social entrepreneurship is gradually becoming a crucial element in the worldwide discussion on volunteerism and civic commitment. It interleaves the passion of a common cause with industrial ethics and is notable and different from the present other types of entrepreneurship models due to its quest for mission associated influence. The previous few years have noticed a striking and surprising progress in the field of social entrepreneurship and has amplified attention ranging throughout all the diverse sectors. The critical difference between social and traditional entrepreneurship can be seen in the founding mission of the venture and the market impressions. Social entrepreneurs emphasize on ways to relieve or eradicate societal pressures and produce progressive externalities or public properties. This study focuses mainly on the meaning of social entrepreneurship to different genres and where does it stand in respect to other forms of entrepreneurship in today's times."

      "Frequently, one person's success comes at the expense of others. We contrast such zero-sum environments in which individuals' payoffs are interdependent to those where payoffs are independent. In a laboratory experiment, we study whether the resulting inequality is perceived differently and how this affects redistribution. Across treatments, we compare a spectator's redistribution of two workers' earnings. If workers do not compete in a zero-sum setting, average redistribution decreases. In a representative survey, we replicate this finding and document that individuals who believe in a zero-sum world support higher levels of redistribution and are more likely to be Democrats."

      "Many industries are exposed to weather risk which they can transfer on financial markets via weather derivatives. Equilibrium models based on partial market clearing became a useful tool for pricing such kind of financial instruments. In a multi-period equilibrium pricing model agents rebalance their portfolio of weather bonds and a risk free asset in each period such that they maximize the expected utility of their incomes constituted by possibly weather dependent profits and payoffs of portfolio positions. We extend the model to a multisite version and apply it to pricing rainfall derivatives for Chinese provinces. By simulating realistic market conditions with two agent types, farmers with profits highly exposed to weather risk and a financial investor diversifying her financial portfolio, we obtain equilibrium prices for weather derivatives on cumulative monthly rainfall. Dynamic portfolio optimization under market clearing and utility indifference of these representative agents determines equilibrium quantity and price for rainfall derivatives."

      "This empirical paper analyzes labor market sorting across establishments using Swedish register data on cognitive and non-cognitive abilities. We draw on the theoretical foundations of Chone' and Kramarz (2021), in which workers are endowed with sets of multidimensional skills that need to be sold in \"bundles\" to employers that differ in their use of each of these skills. The theory also outlines how wage and sorting patterns should evolve when innovations \"unbundle\" the skills through the emergence of markets where each specific skill can be traded s eparately. Our empirical results show that labor is sorted across establishments on both comparative advantage and absolute ability. Furthermore, wage returns to each skill is higher in market segments where employers rely more heavily on workers who specialize in that particular skill. Changes over time are well in line with a process of unbundling; sorting on comparative advantage has increased and the market wages of generalists have risen relative to those of specialists."

It shows that within firms, the employment effects of minimum wage hikes is negative. It finds significant, negative employment effects of minimum wages among small firms and for non-production, less-educated and female workers. The paper also finds that minimum wages are more correlated with small firms' average wages than large firms', suggesting that minimum wages are more binding in small firms."

      "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the return and dividend characteristics of two different types of Malaysian real estate investment trust (REIT) series, namely, conventional and Islamic, against macroeconomic variables over the period 2011-2017. Design/methodology/approach The required data are derived from Datastream database. Multiple regression analysis is used to determine the impact of macroeconomic variables on financial performance of 13 Malaysian REIT series. Findings Results show that the macroeconomic variables are able to predict future returns and dividends of Malaysian REITs. The analysis also suggests that Islamic REITs are seen to be less sensitive to macroeconomic variables and display better portfolio diversification benefits as compared to their conventional counterpart. The ongoing implications for large-cap and small-cap REITs are also highlighted. Research limitations/implications The main limitation of the study is the small percentage of Islamic REITs sample due to limited period of observation available. However, the two Islamic REITs included are representative of Islamic REITs in Malaysia as both of them are listed in the Bursa Malaysia with asset size and market capitalization values more than RM1bn. Practical implications The results of this study may serve as a useful input for financial market players on making strategic business decisions especially with regards to differences between conventional and Islamic REITs characteristics. Originality/value The main contribution of this paper is to explore the relationship between REITs and macroeconomic factors on a unique capital market (Malaysia) that allows comparison between conventional and its Islamic counterpart."

      "Focussing on the firms' internal innovation capabilities and the external co-operative links, it is the aim of the paper to describe the structural composition of Slovenian manufacturing firms with respect to their innovative activities, to analyse their innovative performance using input and output indicators, and to assess their networking intensity with the different actors in the innovation system. Altogether, not only quantitative factors related to innovation will be identified, but also the potential of innovations in industry will be evaluated. This leads to including \"soft\" or contextual factors as preconditions for realising such potentials. For this reason, an innovation survey has been carried out in Slovenia during October 1997 and early 1998, addressing manufacturing firms, business-related service firms and research institutes. The methodology and the questionnaires of the survey have been applied also to other European regions such as Baden, southeast Lower Saxony and Saxony (Germany), Alsace and Gironde (France), Stockholm (Sweden), Wales (UK), South Holland (Netherlands), Vienna (Austria), and Barcelona (Spain) (see for example Backhaus/Seidel 1997; Fritsch et al. 1996; Koschatzky/Traxel1997, Muller 1997). Taking into account these previous experiences in other regions and the knowledge of the Slovene situation, the design of the research has been carefully adapted to the transition context by a joint German-Slovene team. This paper concentrates on reporting results derived from the Slovenian manufacturing industry innovation survey. For comparative reasons, some references are made either to the Baden sampie or to the results derived for Saxony, a region in transition within the process of German unification."

      "We compare employment rates of mothers and childless women over the life course across the birth cohorts from 1940 to 1979 in Austria. By following synthetic cohorts of mothers and childless women up to retirement age, we are able to study both short-term and long-term consequences of having a child. We consider employment participation as well as working time and also perform analyses by educational level. Our study is based on the Austrian microcensus (labour force survey), conducted between 1986 and 2016. The results show that although employment rates of mothers have increased across cohorts, the spread of part-time work has led to a declining work volume of mothers with young children. Return to the workplace is increasingly concentrated when the child is 3 to 5 years old. Part-time employment is primarily adopted (at least with younger children) by highly educated mothers and often remains a long-term arrangement."

      "An aggregation exercise is proposed that aims at in-vestigating whether the fast average adjustment of the disaggregate inflation series of the euro area CPI translates into the slow adjustment of euro area aggregate inflation. We first estimate a dynamic factor model for 404 inflation sub-indices of the euro area CPI. This allows to decompose the dynamics of inflation sub-indices in two parts: one due to a common \"macroeconomic\" shock and one due to sector specific \"idiosyncratic\" shocks. Although \"idiosyncratic\" shocks dominate the variance of sectoral prices, one common factor, which accounts for 30 per cent of the overall variance of the 404 disaggregate inflation series, is the main driver of aggregate dynamics. In addition, the heterogenous propagation of this common shock across sectoral inflation rates, and in particular its slow propagation to inflation rates of services, generates the persistence of aggregate inflation. We conclude that the aggregation process explains a fair amount of aggregate inflation persistence."

      "Special Economic Zones (SEZs) have become common across Southern Africa in the past 20 years. In line with experiences in the rest of the world, they have had at best marginal success. Their essential premise is that it should be more efficient and effective to establish an enclave with world-class administration and infrastructure than to address cross-cutting blockages to growth. In East Asia, this approach was able to build on a broader national industrialization trajectory. In Southern Africa, by contrast, it has proved unable to offset the main constraints on investment. These centre on deep inequality both within and between countries, which leads to continual contestation over economic measures and limited domestic demand, combined with mining dependency, which reduces the scope for substantial linkages through local suppliers or downstream manufacturers. As a result, the SEZs face uncertain and slow regulatory environments, are often unable to deliver on their promises of improved infrastructure and financial incentives, and do little to promote broader industrialization across the region. The case of SEZs underscores the need to develop effective methodologies to test whether policy solutions developed in very different circumstances are viable in Southern Africa. The paper suggests that such a methodology must start with an explicit identification of the problem to be solved and its causes. That lays the basis for evaluating policy options, including those tried abroad, using a theory of change and impact assessments that take into account the differentiated benefits and costs for different stakeholders."

      "For the first time in U.S. history, approximately 10 percent of the U.S. House of Representatives is Hispanic. The greater engagement of Hispanics in national politics has occurred after unprecedented growth in interior immigration enforcement disproportionately impacting Latinos. Using county-level data on all candidates running for congressional elections over the 2008–2018 decade, we find evidence of intensified immigration enforcement suppressing Hispanics' willingness to run for Congress. The effect, which is not present for female or Black minorities, is driven by local police-based measures, and more prevalent in localities without a sanctuary policy and in states with a Republican governor."

      "This paper develops a four-sector equilibrium search and matching model with informal sector employment opportunities and educational choice. We show that underground activities reduce educational attainments if informal employment opportunities mainly are available for low-educated workers. A more zealous enforcement policy will in this case improve educational incentives as it reduces the attractiveness of remaining a low-educated worker. However, unemployment also increases. Characterizing the optimal enforcement policies, we find that relatively more audits should be targeted towards the sector employing low-educated workers; elsewise, a too low stock of educated workers is materialized."

      "This paper analyzes the effect of injunctions on royalty negotiations for standard essential patents. We develop a model in which courts grant injunctions only when they have sufficient evidence that the prospective licensee is unwilling, in line with the way we understand Courts to operate in Europe. In such a framework the prospective licensee has a powerful strategic tool: the offers that he makes to the patent holder will affect the royalty rate that the Court may adopt as well as the probability of being subject to injunctions (and the liability for litigation costs). We find that despite the availability of injunctions, the holder of a sufficiently weak patent will end up accepting below FRAND rates, in particular when litigation cost are high. We also find that the prospective licensee will sometimes prefer to litigate and the holder of a sufficiently strong patent will always end up in litigation by rejecting offers below FRAND. This arises in particular when the prospective licensee has little to fear from being found unwilling, namely when the trial takes time (so that the threat of injunctions is less powerful),andwhen litigation costs are low. Importantly, we thus find that hold up (royalties above the fair rate) as well as reverse hold up (royalties below the fair rate) may arise in equilibrium."

      "We show that 70% of Chinese listed companies are ultimately controlled by government agencies, thereby indicating that state ownership remains widespread in China's stock markets. Three questions are considered that are related to government control structures and their impact on firm value: (1) how do government agencies maintain their control of listed companies; (2) what are the impacts of different government control structures on firm value; and (3) are these impacts different in local government and central government-controlled firms? We find that the Chinese government controls listed companies directly or indirectly through solely state-owned enterprises (SSOEs). Taking into account the trade-off between political and agency costs, we show that firm value increases when some control rights are decentralized from the government to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Moreover, decentralization improves significantly the performance of local government- controlled, but not central government-controlled firms."

      "Im Jahr 2015 werden die BRIC-Staaten ein höheres weltwirtschaftliches Gewicht als die Euroländer haben. Im Zeitraum 2002 bis 2010 waren Brasilien, Russland, Indien und vor allem China eine globale Konjunkturlokomotive. Die Importzuwächse dieser vier Länder waren in diesem Zeitraum mit Ausnahme der Jahre 2004 und 2005 in jedem Jahr größer als die der USA. Dabei nahm China eine dominante Rolle ein. Die deutsche Wirtschaft profitiert von dem starken Importsog der BRIC-Staaten – vor allem durch seine starken Exportsektoren Elektro- und Chemieindustrie sowie durch den Maschinen- und Fahrzeugbau. Die Erfolge dieser deutschen Branchen auf den jeweiligen BRIC-Absatzmärkten fallen allerdings sehr unterschiedlich aus, nicht zuletzt wegen der starken weltweiten Konkurrenz."

In this paper we therefore contribute to the literature by assessing the implications of low-probability extreme events on environmental policy in a continuous-time real options model with 'tail risk'. In a nutshell, our results indicate the importance of tail risk and call for foresighted pre-emptive climate policies."

      "The study investigates linkages between financial development, income inequality and renewable energy consumption from 39 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The empirical evidence is based on data for the period 2004-2014, Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) and Quantile Regressions (QR). The GMM results show that financial development unconditionally promotes renewable energy consumption while income inequality counteracts the underlying positive effect. The QR results reveal that the GMM findings only withstand empirical validity in bottom quantiles of the renewable energy consumption distribution. In order to increase room for policy implications for the promotion of renewable energy consumption, critical masses of income inequality that should not be exceeded are computed for bottom quantiles of the renewable energy consumption distribution while income inequality thresholds that should be exceeded are computed for top quantiles of the renewable energy consumption distribution. The study reconciles two strands of the literature. Theoretical, practical and policy implications are discussed."

      "Welfare participation is an important indicator of how successfully immigrants perform in the host country. This paper examines this issue for the UK, which has experienced a large growth in its immigrant flows and population levels in recent years, especially following EU enlargement in 2004. The analysis focuses in particular on the types of benefits that immigrants tend to claim as well as examining differences by area of origin. It also examines the factors that determine social benefit claims, including an investigation of the impact of education, ethnicity and years since migration. Social welfare claims vary considerably by immigrant group as well as by the type of benefit claimed in the UK. There is also some variation by gender within the migrant groups."

      "Two issues stand out in this conversation. The first concerns the unfinished business of the global fight against the scourge of poverty, which impacts one region more than most: Africa. At the same time, a key pre-requisite for economic performance - affordable and efficient public infrastructure and services - remains lacking in this region - notably, in Sub-Saharan Africa. To address this, the region itself has initiated a major, long-term, continent-wide infrastructure development programme which is intended to fix this problem sustainably - namely, the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA). Its success foreshadows an economic transformation that will potentially usher in an emergent Africa in the 21st century. Secondly, in one area of economic activity - trade in government procurement markets - the revised WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) is emerging as a multi-dimensional tool of trade, governance and development. The thesis of this paper is that GPA participation by African countries - a prospect which, to date, they have declined to take up - holds strong potential to reinforce the positive effects of PIDA and to contribute to the region's growth and development more generally.

      "Environmental entrepreneurship bears great potential to promote sustainable development. Several influencing factors on the level of environmental orientation have been identified by past literature. In this respect, mixed results occur with regard to the influence of gender on environmental entrepreneurship. However, these studies simply investigated the level of a single entrepreneur by distinguishing between male and female individuals, although ventures are increasingly founded by entrepreneurial teams. Consequently, this study quantitatively addresses the research question how the gender of founding teams influences the environmental orientation of entrepreneurial ventures. Based on a dataset of entrepreneurial ventures from the US and Germany, our results indicate that the level of environmental orientation is not dependent on the share of female members, but rather on the gender diversity of the founding team. We conclude that gender diversity within the entrepreneurial team is necessary to address both ecological and economic goals of environmental entrepreneurship. Based on this finding, theoretical and practical implications are drawn, in particular for policy, entrepreneurial teams and entrepreneurship training."

      "The need for a better understanding of radical uncertainty might have never been greater. Ill-preparedness for natural hazards, a resurgence of serious public health concerns or illusions of control over unruly technology question the extent to which we can 'really' shape the world around us. Human-made crises, too, test how we routinely do things. We ask how organisations and actors within them prepare for a collapse of meaning and practise radical uncertainty. Given the breadth and depth of the region's energy (and, as some would argue, turbulences), Asia provides a fitting context for exploring accommodation to and learning from low-probability, high-impact incidents. By reviewing the business and management research on shocks in Asia, we find that there is a strong human side to dealing with the unknown. We argue that what organisations and actors within them do prior, during and after a shock event is substantially contingent upon cultural environments. To elaborate, we discuss the role of the uncertainty avoidance dimension of national culture in dealing with shock events. We further combine this dimension with the universalism-particularism dimension to discuss future research directions. Our exploration of resultant differences in preparedness, resourcefulness and learning offers a more rounded inquiry into how Asian business actors deal with shocks."

      "Economists often analyze cross-sectional data to estimate the value people implicit place on attributes of goods using hedonic methods. Usually strong enough assumptions are made on the functional form of utility to point identify individuals' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for changes in attribute levels. Instead, this paper develops a new way to partially identify WTP under a weak set of conditions on the shape of individual indifference curves. In particular, indifference curves are assumed to be increasing and convex in an attribute-cost space that is finitely bounded above. These shape restrictions provide informative partial identification without relying on functional form restrictions for utility. Identification given general, potentially discrete, as well as smooth price functions is analyzed. To illustrate this method, we contribute to the literature on the value of a statistical life (VSL) by analyzing labor market data to study people's willingness to pay (WTP) for reductions in levels of fatal risk. The paper contrasts VSL estimates from conventional analysis with the bounds obtained under this new approach using a common data set. The data are shown to be consistent with a wide range of WTP values even given equilibrium and credible shape restrictions. This suggests that conventional estimates may be driven by functional form restrictions imposed on utility rather than by the data or properties of equilibrium."

      "To be able to redress retrospective panels into random samples and correct for any recall and/or design bias the data might suffer from, this paper builds on the methodology proposed by Langot and Yassin (2015) and extends it to correct the data on the individual transaction level (i.e. micro level). It creates user-friendly weights that can be readily used by researchers relying on retrospective panels extracted from the Egypt and Jordan Labor Market Panel Surveys(ELMPS and JLMPS respectively). The technique suggested shows that it is sufficient to have population moments - stocks and/or transitions (for at least one point in time) to correct overor under-reporting biases in the retrospective data. The paper proposes two types of microdata weights: (1) naive proportional weights and (2) differentiated predicted weights. Both transaction-level weights i.e. for each transition at a certain point in time, as well as panel weights i.e. for an entire job or non-employment spell, are built. In order to highlight the importance of these weights, the paper also offers an application using these weights. The determinants of labor market transitions in Egypt and Jordan are analyzed via a multinomial regression analysis with and without the weights. The impact of these weights on the regressions estimations and coefficients is therefore examined and shown significant among the different types of labor market transitions, especially separations."

      "This paper assesses how a permanent shift from financing a public pay-as-you-go pension by direct (labour income) taxation towards financing it by indirect(consumption) taxation affects the economy and welfare. To this end, we use anoverlapping-generations-augmented two-region general equilibrium framework withsearch frictions on the labour market. The analysed tax reform partially shifts thetax burden from domestic to foreign producers and lowers marginal costs of domes-tic production and generates positive domestic macroeconomic effects. In addition,the partial postponement of a household's tax burden to retirement leads to highersavings and increases domestic assets. However, for some time after implementationof the tax reform, the policy-induced increase in consumption costs makes retireesand households close to retirement worse off. Moreover, the increase in domesticnet foreign assets implies that consumption of foreign households eventually falls,which stands in contrast to what is commonly found in models without an endoge-nous savings motive."

      "This paper discusses the likely evolution of U.S. inflation in the near and medium term on the basis of (1) past U.S. experience with very low levels of inflation, (2) the most recent Japanese experience with deflation, and (3) recent U.S. micro evidence on downward nominal wage rigidity. Our findings question the view that stable long-run inflation expectations and downward nominal wage rigidity will provide sufficient support to prices such that deflation can be avoided. We show that an inflation model fitted on Japanese data over the past 20 years, which accounts for both short- and long-run inflation expectations, matches the recent U.S. inflation experience quite well. While the model indicates that U.S. inflation might be subject to a lower bound, it does not rule out a prolonged period of mild deflation going forward. In addition, our micro evidence on wages suggests no obvious downward rigidity in the firm's wage costs, downward rigidity in individual wages notwithstanding. As a consequence, downward nominal wage rigidity may provide little offset to deflationary pressures in the current U.S. situation, despite some circumstantial evidence that this channel might have been at work in the past."

      "Limited attention has been paid to how well social mobility measures debated and used to study industrial countries perform in analysis of low-income settings. Following brief, selective reviews of the axiomatic and econometric literatures, three mobility concepts illustrate how properties that appear innocuous in industrial country analysis become problematic when downward mobility includes descents into destitution. For origin-independence measures-the most widely used in research on developing countries to date-axiomatic propriety and cognizance of co-residency-induced and other more well-known sources of estimation bias are not enough. This paper adopts the term 'perverse fluidity' from sociology to define the estimate bias attributable to intergenerational poverty descents. Using simple experiments and data from India, poverty descents generate perverse fluidity biases in intergenerational regression and correlation coefficients of up to 50 per cent, suggesting that seemingly 'good' mobility news may be 'bad' and that mobility comparisons are more precarious than acknowledged so far."

      "The purpose of this contribution is to illustrate the mechanism by which higher oil prices might lead to lower interest rates in the context of a simple model that takes into account the global external savings equilibrium. The simple model has interesting implications for how one views the huge US current account deficit and how the emergence of China's savings surplus and oil supply shocks impact the global economy.We show that the new equilibrium is located at a lower interest rate but also at a lower income level than without the China effect. Moreover, we argue that the lower real interest rates resulting from excess OPEC savings have facilitated the adjustment to the subprime crisis."

      "Nach den neuesten Ergebnissen des ifo Konjunkturtests Leasing stieg der Geschäftsklimaindex im vierten Quartal 2003 bereits zum vierten Mal in Folge und ist so gut wie seit fast drei Jahren nicht mehr. Positiv ist vor allem, dass die Leasinggesellschaften nicht nur auf eine bessere Zukunft hofften, sondern auch ihre derzeitige Geschäftslage günstiger beurteilten. Fast jedes vierte Unternehmen bewertete die Lage als günstig, 73% als befriedigend, und nur noch 3% Testteilnehmer empfanden den augenblicklichen Geschäftsverlauf als schlecht. Bei der Beschäftigungsentwicklung zeichnen sich aber kaum positive Tendenzen ab. Wieder etwas häufiger als zuvor, berichteten 62% der Leasingunternehmen über Behinderungen der Geschäftstätigkeit, wobei jedes dritte über die rechtlichen und steuerlichen Rahmenbedingungen klagte."

      "The rising popularity of webtoons, a popular type of digital content, led to emergence of an interesting phenomenon known as transcreation. Transcreation indicates fans' twofold activity of translating and recreating webtoons into a new language, while maintaining originality of the content. Although transcreators are playing a significant role in facilitating the spread of webtoons in the global market, the role of such transcreators has received scant attention. By employing the means-end chain approach through laddering interviews, the study explicates fans' goal structure in transcreation of webtoons. This empirical study provides insights into fans' involvement in the digital media industry."

      "The new government in Israel is politically further to the right than any other before it. The success of the radical right parties and their inclusion in the government are the results of a long-term transformation of Israel's political landscape. One characteristic of this development is the genesis of a right-wing majority, accompanied by a shift to the right of the mainstream, and the political legitimisation of the most radical segment of Israeli society. The common denominator of this government is its anti-liberal impetus, which amounts to a reorganisation of the state. The government intends to weaken democratic mechanisms, especially the system of checks and balances, the status of the Supreme Court, and that of fundamental rights. Instead, majoritarian principles are to be strengthened, placing few limits on government majorities. This disruptive approach also applies to the conflict with the Palestinians. Here, victory is sought: The integration of the West Bank into the legal territory of the state of Israel is to be made irreversible."

      "In Berlin ist die Zahl der Erwerbstätigen in den letzten zehn Jahren noch stärker als in Gesamtdeutschland gewachsen. Allerdings konnte die Arbeitslosigkeit nicht überdurchschnittlich abgebaut werden, da gleichzeitig das Arbeitskräftepotential in der Stadt erheblich zugenommen hat. An Bedeutung gewonnen haben Tätigkeiten, für die eine mittlere Qualifikation benötigt wird. Die zwar kräftig gesunkene, aber immer noch weit über dem Bundesdurchschnitt liegende Arbeitslosigkeit verschiebt sich damit mehr und mehr zu den Hartz-IV-Empfängern und zu den Geringqualifizierten sowie hin zu den Akademikern. Der starke Beschäftigungsaufbau wurde dadurch begünstigt, dass die Produktivitätssteigerungen auch im Vergleich zum gesamten Bundesgebiet gering waren. Dies dürfte auch eine der Ursachen dafür sein, dass Berlin bei den Löhnen weiterhin zurückliegt. Die schwache Produktivitätsentwicklung verweist überdies auf eine unzureichende Innovationsfähigkeit, die verhindert, dass Berlin hinsichtlich Wirtschaftskraft und Erwerbseinkommen einen Platz einnimmt, der einer Hauptstadt angemessen wäre. Dazu bedarf es auch in Zukunft eines gut qualifizierten Arbeitskräftepotentials, woraus sich die drängendsten Aufgaben für die Politik ableiten: die Bekämpfung des eklatanten Lehrstellenmangels sowie die Verbesserung der Leistungsfähigkeit der Schulen und der Berufsorientierung.",
      "Over the past ten years, the number of employed persons in Berlin has increased more dynamically than it has anywhere else in the country, resulting in a decrease in unemployment. But because the city's potential labor force has also experienced considerable growth, Berlin's unemployment rate remains well above the national average. Since jobs requiring intermediate qualifications have become more prevalent, this high unemployment rate is being influenced more and more by the increasing numbers of Hartz-IV recipients and low-skilled workers as well as academics. Berlin's strong employment growth has been facilitated by the fact that the productivity gains are low, even in a nationwide comparison. This is also likely one of the reasons that Berlin is still behind when it comes to wages. The weak productivity development also indicates an insufficient innovation capacity that is preventing Berlin from achieving the economic power and income levels that would befit a national capital. Now and in the future, such a transformation requires a well-qualified workforce-which is why policymakers' highest and most urgent priorities should include combating the glaring lack of apprenticeships as well as improving the quality of local schools and vocational training."

      "We propose a Hawkish-Dovish (HD) indicator that measures the degree of 'hawkishness' or 'dovishness' of the media's perception of the ECB's tone at each press conference. We compare two methods to calculate the indicator: semantic orientation and Support Vector Machines text classification. We show that the latter method tends to provide more stable and accurate measurements of perception on a labelled test set. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential use of this indicator with several applications: we perform a correlation analysis with a set of interest rates, use Latent Dirichlet Allocation to detect the dominant topics in the news articles, and estimate a set of Taylor rules. The findings provide decisive evidence in favour of using an advanced text mining classification model to measure the medias perception and the Taylor rule application confirms that communication plays a significant role in enhancing the accuracy when trying to estimate the bank's reaction function."

      "This paper analyzes a common-value, first-price auction with state-dependent participation. The number of bidders, which is unobservable to them, depends on the true value. For participation patterns with many bidders in each state, the bidding equilibrium may be of a \"pooling\" type---with high probability, the winning bid is the same across states and is below the ex-ante expected value---or of a \"partially revealing\" type---with no significant atoms in the winning bid distribution and an expected winning bid increasing in the true value. Which of these forms will arise is determined by the likelihood ratio at the top of the signal distribution and the participation across states. We fully characterize this relation and show how the participation pattern determines the extent of information aggregation by the price."

      "Does increasing product-market competition from foreign firms affect domestic labor shares? By combining detailed Swedish firm-level data with an instrumental variable design, I show that an increase in import penetration caused by increased global competition results in a decrease in domestic industry-level labor shares. The decrease comes both from a reallocation of firms' market shares and a fall in labor shares at the firm level. The analysis shows that the negative effect of competition on firm-level labor shares is driven by an increase in productivity that is not met by a corresponding increase in compensation to labor. I use these findings to calibrate a heterogeneous-firm model where domestic and foreign firms compete on the domestic product market. The calibrated model predicts that an increase in foreign competition corresponding to a one standard deviation increase in import penetration results in a 1.12 percentage point increase in welfare."

      "We consider a game of information transmission, with one informed decision maker gathering information from one or more informed senders. Private information is (conditionally) correlated across players, and communication is cheap talk. For the one sender case, we show that correlation unambiguously tightens the existence conditions for a truth-telling equilibrium. We then generalize the model to an arbitrary number of senders, and we find that, in this case, the effect of correlation on the incentives to report information truthfully is non monotone, and correlation may discipline senders' equilibrium behavior, making it easier to sustain truth-telling."

      "Purpose: Lean Management has evolved into an inter-disciplinary subject with linkages to Operations Management, Organizational Behaviour, and Strategic Management. The objective of this paper is to review journal articles on lean published in major academic sources with a view to provide taxonomy of the field of lean management facilitating identification of the pertinent themes that exists in literature, while presenting an overview of the main definitions, chronological evolution, diffusion among developed and emerging economies Design/methodology/approach: A review of literature has been conducted which includes 447 research articles in 51 Journals from Academic sources: Emerald Insight, T&F and Science Direct with main focus on lean management. Findings: An analysis of the surveyed literature brings to light an exponential increase in number of papers in the last 3 decades. The paper conducted study of lean in 3 phases i.e. Pre 2001, 2001-2010, Post 2010; enabling the study of maturity of lean. Observation regarding diffusion of lean globally reveals that lean has been adopted by both developed and emerging economies with noteworthy tilt towards its adoption in Asian countries in the recent past whereas initially it was confined to developed countries. New themes that have emerged such as Industry 4.0 and sustainability in the context of lean have been identified. Research limitations/implications: The aim of the paper is succinct representation of the current status and facilitating future research in the field. Originality/value: The present business environment with its rapid changes in market, rise in its economic, technical, and socio-psychological complexities has paved way for acceptance of lean as an operating strategy in a pervasive manner. The present study extends efforts of previous studies to analyse diffusion of lean globally, themes that have emerged and also includes more contemporary research with focus on its spread to emerging economies."

      "We discuss the effect of personalized pricing on profits and welfare in a Hotelling model in which consumers can simultaneously purchase from both firms. As the additional gain from the second purchase increases, personalized pricing is more likely to harm (resp., benefit) consumers (resp., firms). If the additional gain is interme- diate, personalized pricing improves consumer welfare and firms' profits, contrasting with the standard result: personalized pricing benefits consumers but harms firms. When firms can choose one of the pricing policies: uniform or personalized, both choose uniform (resp., personalized) pricing under some parameters (resp., in any case); multiple equilibria can co-exist."

      "We present a theoretical model in tourism economics, assuming that the market for tourism is an oligopoly with differentiated products. Destinations (i.e., countries, regions, sites or even firms) can invest in order to improve their carrying capacity that can be interpreted as the stock of physical, natural or cultural resources. Tourism flows yield current revenues, but they are usually detrimental for the cultural or natural resource stock over time. We find the solution of the dynamic model, and in particular we find the open-loop Nash equilibrium of the game among the destinations, under alternative settings, depending on whether the arrivals are exogenous or endogenous, and depending on whether the degree of differentiation among destinations is exogenous or endogenous. The model is rather general, and it can provide answers to different specific questions, like the choice between mass- vs. elite-tourism development strategies; the effect of the number of competing products upon profits; the optimal degree of product differentiation."

      "Using a Dynamic Semiparametric Factor Model (DSFM) we investigate the term structure of interest rates. The proposed methodology is applied to monthly interest rates for four southern European countries: Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain from the introduction of the Euro to the recent European sovereign-debt crisis. Analyzing this extraordinary period, we compare our approach with the standard market method - dynamic Nelson-Siegel model. Our findings show that two nonparametric factors capture the spatial structure of the yield curve for each of the bond markets separately. We attributed both factors to the slope of the yield curve. For panel term structure data, three nonparametric factors are necessary to explain 95% variation. The estimated factor loadings are unit root processes and reveal high persistency. In comparison with the benchmark model, the DSFM technique shows superior short term forecasting."

      "Currently, numerous physician practices in industrial and emerging countries are being taken over by private equity firms and integrated into novel physician corporations. This involves private equity firms producing a global wealth chain (GWC) between their investors and the target asset, using offshore financial centres to facilitate tax‐avoiding reflux of capital. Moreover, they are opening up ambulatory health care as an asset for capital investment by overcoming previous market barriers to ambulatory health care via a legal construct. In this paper, we trace the spatial links of these finance‐side and sector‐specific corporate chains based on a capital flow analysis of private equity takeovers of Medical Care Centres (MCCs) in Bavaria, Germany. With our heuristics of a double‐layered GWC, which enables the extraction of value from the German health system, we contribute to the emerging GWC debate that aims to conceptualise the complex and often opaque spatialisations of financialisation processes."

      "Three decades ago, and with very few precedents, Spain's two principal banking corporations began an intense process of expansion throughout Latin America. Not only did they compete with one other in this new market, but they also faced competition from domestic Latin American banks and other foreign banks. This paper analyses the key elements that encouraged these two banks to enter the Latin American market. It assesses their success or failure in each country they entered, and in the subcontinent as a whole. Finally, it examines the different strategies they used to achieve their aims."

      "The recent financial crisis emphasised the need for effective financial stability analyses and tools for detecting systemic risk. This paper looks at assessment of banking sector resilience through stress testing. We argue such analyses are valuable even in emerging economies that suffer from limited data availability, short time series and structural breaks. We propose a top-down stress test methodology that employs relatively limited information to overcome this data problem. Moreover, as credit growth in emerging economies tends to be rather volatile, we rely on dynamic approach projecting key balance sheet items. Application of our proposed stress test framework to the Russian banking sector reveals a high sensitivity of the capital adequacy ratio to the economic cycle that shows up in both of the two-year macroeconomic scenarios considered: a baseline and an adverse one. Both scenarios indicate the need for capital increase in the Russian banking sector. Furthermore, given that Russia's banking sector is small and fragmented relative to advanced economies, the loss of external financing can cause profound economic stress, especially for medium-sized and small enterprises. The Russian state has a low public debt-to-GDP ratio and plays decisive role in the banking sector. These factors allow sufficient fiscal space for recapitalisation of problematic banks under both of our proposed baseline and adverse scenarios."

      "Advertising plays an essential role for creating brand awareness that leads to consumer behavior toward services and products. The objective of this research is to investigate the role of mid-roll video advertising regarding its perceived intrusiveness and value on viewers' response to those ads. Data from 200 users who have experienced mid-roll video advertising were analyzed in a two-step method via structural equation modeling (SEM) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The indirect impacts were investigated and compared via the bootstrap approach. The analysis confirms that the value of mid-roll video advertising is significantly and positively associated with attitude toward mid-roll video advertising and word-of-mouth (WOM) intention. In addition, the positive connection between WOM intention and attitude as well as viewers' response are observed. However, the negative association between perceived intrusiveness and attitude is found as well in this research. For the contributions, the result not only strengthens the importance of the advertising value theory as a framework to explain the impact of advertising, but also provides recommendations for advertisers and content creators regarding some managerial actions that may need to be taken in order to satisfy consumers."

      "Seit nahezu einem Jahr sehen sich Gesellschaft und Wirtschaft erheblichen Belastungen durch die gesundheitliche Bedrohung der Corona-Pandemie und den dadurch ausgelösten Beschränkungen ausgesetzt. Die Folgen waren bisher eine der schwersten Wirtschaftskrisen in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik, Bildungsausfälle großen Ausmaßes und zunehmende soziale Probleme. Die schnelle Entwicklung von Impfstoffen gibt Hoffnung, die Krankheit zurückzudrängen und schrittweise zu einer Normalisierung des Lebens zu kommen. Aber auch bei erfolgreichen Impfungen ist nicht damit zu rechnen, dass der Virus wieder verschwinden wird. Offene Grenzen in Europa und darüber hinaus und fehlender flächendeckender Impfschutz lassen es wahrscheinlich erscheinen, dass dauerhaft mit einem verbleibenden Corona-Risiko umgegangen werden muss. Das gilt umso mehr, wenn vor allem auf harte Kontaktbeschränkungen gesetzt wird, die immer nur unvollständig und temporär sein können, und die Impfgeschwindigkeit zu langsam ist. Bei der Bekämpfung der Pandemie gilt es, Kosten der Bekämpfung und Schäden eines verbleibenden Risikos miteinander abzuwägen. Dass die Randlösung einer vollständigen Risikobeseitigung durch kurzzeitige, aber harte Maßnahmen zu langfristiger Sicherung vor Ansteckung führt und damit auch die wirtschaftlich überlegende Option ist, ist nicht wahrscheinlich. Umgekehrt müssen die Kapazitäten gestärkt werden, die einen sicheren Umgang mit immer wieder aufkommenden Corona-Fällen ermöglicht. [...]",
      "For almost a year, German society and economy have been significantly constrained by the health threat posed by the Covid pandemic and the restrictions it has triggered. The consequences to date have amounted to one of the most severe economic crises in the history of the Federal Republic, significant educational shortcomings and increasing social problems. The rapid development of vaccines now raises the hope of pushing back the virus and gradually returning to normal life. However, even with successful vaccinations, the virus is not expected to disappear. It seems likely that the combination of open borders in Europe and beyond along with a lack of universal vaccination coverage will require permanent management of residual Covid risks. This applies particularly if the focus is placed on strict contact restrictions, which can only ever be incomplete and temporary, and if the vaccination rates are too low. The key to fighting the pandemic is to balance the cost of control against the damage of any remaining risk. It is doubtful that the marginal solution of complete risk elimination through temporary but harsh measures will lead to long-term protection against infection rates and thus be the economically superior option. Conversely, capacities to safely manage recurrent corona cases need to be strengthened. [...]"

      "Much research has been conducted on immigration into Ireland in recent years using data from the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS), the official source for labour market data in Ireland. As it is known that the QNHS undercounts immigrants in Ireland, a concern exists over whether the profile of immigrants being provided is accurate. For example, QNHS-based research has shown that immigrants in Ireland are a highly-educated group. However, if it is the case that those who are missed by the QNHS are more heavily drawn from among low-skilled immigrants, then the profile being reported and used in other research may be inaccurate. In this paper, we use the Irish Census of 2006 to assess the reliability of the profile of immigrants provided by the QNHS by comparing the characteristics of immigrants in both datasets. In general, we find that the QNHS does indeed provide a reliable picture and that earlier findings on the education levels of immigrants in Ireland hold."

      "Internal migration flows from rural to urban areas have greatly contributed to population declines in many rural areas across both Europe and the US. At the same time there is mounting evidence for a tight connection between internal migration and shifts in labor demand, with the latter being heavily affected by the rise of automation technologies. Therefore this paper analyzes the effects industrial robotization has had on manufacturing employment and internal migration in Austria during the period 2003-2016, specifically focusing on rural-to-urban migration flows. The results show that robotization has caused significant declines in manufacturing employment to which populations reacted by increased out-migration. This migratory response takes the form of rural-to-urban migration, thereby contributing to population declines in many rural areas in Austria. These rural-to-urban movements are primarily driven by young and medium/low skilled individuals, i.e. those groups that bear the strongest shock incidence."

      "On the China-Europe route, the sea used to dominate entirely continental transports, but in the last decade the railways started to gain some ground. However, it took number of years that railway volumes grew as significant, and finally coronavirus era (2020-2021) promoted much higher usage. This was the case not only on the main route Poland-China, but also on the more northern and lower-volume routes, such as Finland-China. This research uses regression analysis of the latter route to reveal factors that have an effect on rail container volumes. It is shown that Baltic Dry Index (BDI) and coronavirus related variables have influenced most container volumes on the Finland-China route. Oil price development has also played some sort of role. Interestingly, sea port handling of Finland does not play any significance in the model, nor does foreign trade between countries. Findings could be explained with the low starting ground of service, and dominance of sea transportation."

      "This paper estimates the distribution-led regime of the US economy for the period 1947-2019. We use a time varying parameter model, which allows for changes in the regime over time. To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper that has attempted to do this. This innovation is important, because there is no reason to expect that the regime of the US economy (or any economy for that matter) remains constant over time. On the contrary, there are significant reasons that point to changes in the regime. We find that the US economy became more profitled in the first postwar decades until the 1970s and has become less profit-led since; it is slightly wage-led over the last fifteen years."

      "In recent times, the attention given to the importance of tourism as a particularly efficient way to promote regional development has significantly increased, owing to the capacity of tourism to create income and employment and to generate synergies within other economic sectors. Tourism is worldwide considered to have a key role in the economic development of regions, and therefore, is widely used to reduce regional disparities and to improve quality of life standards in local communities. Greece has a long tradition in tourism, mainly due to a gifted natural environment and rich cultural heritage. However, tourism development across regions is highly unbalanced. This is attributed particularly to the highly insular and mountainous geomorphology of the country, the uneven distribution of natural, socio-cultural and environmental resources, and the lack of appropriate regional and tourism development policies during the post war decades. The dominance of the mass tourism model adopted since the early seventies in the country and the extensive structural inefficiencies, are effectively hindering the existing potential for a balanced and viable tourism development. The main objective of this paper is to investigate tourism development disparities among Greek regions and to identify factors and occurring patterns that affect the tourism development of regions in order to formulate a strategy and policy framework for balanced regional tourism development. In the first section of this paper an overview of the theoretical approaches related to tourism and balanced regional development is provided. Next, the role of tourism in the Greek national economy and the country's position in the international tourism market are examined. Following an analysis of the evolution of regional tourism disparities in Greece during the last decades in the third section, quantitative techniques are used to assess intra- and cross-regional tourism inequalities in the fourth section. The results reveal the existence of strong regional disparities in tourism development among Greek regions, although the development pattern differs among different types of regions. Finally, in the last section some concluding remarks and policy recommendations are presented, leading to the identification of issues for further research."

      "We estimate the elasticity of substitution of a country’s imports, and that of its exports on the world market, for EU countries using sector level trade data. We present a new empirical strategy based on the identification scheme by Feenstra (1994), which enables the estimation of elasticities from data on exports. Moreover, our use of bootstrap methods allows us to obtain better elasticity measures, and to better characterize their accuracy. Our results show much heterogeneity in the estimates of the elasticity of substitution across industrial sectors. This, in turn, points to heterogeneity across countries, due to different production and trade structures. We obtain aggregate elasticities for the EU27 countries, with a mean of 3.5 for imports and 4.0 for exports, bringing us closer to traditional estimates and bridging the gap between the newer micro data estimates and the more traditional estimates found in the macroeconomic literature."

      "Ethical investments have become increasingly popular over the past years. Ethical funds restrict their investment based on environmental, social and/or ethical criteria. Prior research on the performance of ethical versus non-ethical funds yields mixed results. This paper investigates the differences in risk profiles and realized returns between ethical and non-ethical funds. A sample of 23 ethical funds and 152 non-ethical funds covering the time period between 2000 and 2007 is investigated. The analysis of the portfolio composition shows that there are small differences in the structure of portfolios concerning industry composition and company size. However, the ethical funds tend to hold more stocks in their portfolios than non-ethical ones. The results provide some evidence on the underperformance of ethical funds; this underperformance is stronger in years of poor stock market performance, which indicates that systematic risk of ethical funds may be higher."

      "The March Current Population Survey (CPS) is the primary data source for estimation of levels and trends in labor earnings and income inequality in the USA. Time-inconsistency problems related to top coding in theses data have led many researchers to use the ratio of the 90th and 10th percentiles of these distributions (P90/P10) rather than a more traditional summary measure of inequality. With access to public use and restricted-access internal CPS data, and bounding methods, we show that using P90/P10 does not completely obviate timeinconsistency problems, especially for household income inequality trends. Using internal data, we create consistent cell mean values for all top-coded public use values that, when used with public use data, closely track inequality trends in labor earnings and household income using internal data. But estimates of longer-term inequality trends with these corrected data based on P90/P10 differ from those based on the Gini coefficient. The choice of inequality measure matters."

      "This paper estimated the pass-through effects of yuan's exchange rates on prices of the US and Japanese imports from the People's Republic of China (PRC). Empirical results show that, a 1% nominal appreciation of the yuan would result in a 0.23% increase in prices of the US imports in the short run and 0.47% in the long run. Japanese import prices were relatively more responsive to changes of the bilateral exchange rates between the yuan and the yen. For a 1% nominal appreciation of the yuan against the yen, Japanese import prices would be expected to rise 0.55% in the short run and 0.99%, a complete pass-through, in the long run. The high degree of pass-through effects were also found at the disaggregated sectoral level: food, raw materials, apparel, manufacturing, and machinery. However, further analysis indicated that the high pass-through effects in the case of Japan were mainly attributed to the PRC's policy to peg the yuan to the United States (US) dollar, and that the dollar is used as a dominant invoicing currency for the PRC's exports to Japan. After controlling the currency invoicing factor, I found no evidence that the yuan's cumulative appreciation since July 2005 was passed on to prices of Japanese imports at either the aggregate or disaggregated levels. The estimated low pass-through effects of the yuan's appreciation suggest that a moderate appreciation of the yuan would have very little impact on the PRC's trade surplus."

      "The study aims to contribute to the debate on social welfare in Brazil through an analysis focused on the normative action of the State on the subject from October 1988 until September 2022. October 1988 marks the date when a new, democratic constitution was enacted, which defined social assistance, social security and health care as interconnected social rights of citizenship under the umbrella term social welfare. We carried out a content analysis of the legal production at the federal level, considering the general theme social welfare as the universe of analysis and each piece of federal legislation (constitutional amendments, laws, provisional laws, presidential decrees and legislative decrees) as units of analysis. The software Iramuteq was used to perform some of the content analysis, including descriptive statistics of frequent expressions, similitude analysis, correspondence factor analysis and descendant hierarchical classification (Reinert method). The most frequently addressed subject in this legislative production was the execution of the Social Welfare Budget (OSS), followed by its financing and/or taxation. We define this prominence of budgetary concerns as \"fiscal-budgetary formalism\" and discuss its consequences. On the other hand, no prominence was given to the policy areas that constitute social welfare. When they do appear in laws, decrees and similar documents, they are usually themed as completely separate topics, not being the object of a joint legislative action that treats them in an integrated way as public policy. Thus, the conclusion of this work is that social welfare has not been recognized as an issue of public policy in the federal legislative action in the analyzed period."

      "Northern territories (including the Arctic) occupy over 80% of Russian area. Development of these regions is based on ?resource? model, while other approaches have been ignored because of severe environmental conditions. The aim of this study was to assess an ability of northern regions to generate and diffuse innovations. The study was methodologically divided into three stages. The objective of the first and the second stage was to compare innovation capacities of northern and other Russian regions. An ability to create new knowledge is described by a number of indexes, the ability to extend and apply innovations - by a logistic function from model for innovation diffusion. This work confirmed the hypothesis of high concentration of the potential in major agglomerations and research centers, including Siberian cities: Tomsk, Novosibirsk, and Krasnoyarsk. Some arctic regions were characterized by high creative potential, but low rate of diffusion: Krasnoyarsk, Magadan, Sakha. The first fact can be explained by conservation of the Soviet scientific infrastructure and by initiative and mutual assistance of northern communities. The second fact is related to low population density and interaction. The key disadvantage of the method is in inadequate quality of Russian statistics. On the second stage, the authors identified innovation clusters in the sphere of environmental management. This sphere, connected with sustainable development, is a quickly developing innovative sector of economy, which includes remote sensing and GIS technologies, new technologies of exploration, hydro-meteorological and ecological modeling, etc. Leading university centers were identified by expert surveys and verified by ?Delphi? procedures. Centers had formed clusters, which were organized by principal of innovation cycle: fundamental and applied science, and enterprises. More than 30% of organizations were located in the northern regions. To classify the clusters the authors calculated an index of innovation capacity, which included the assessment of competence, new technologies and business-incubators, as well as the index of cohesion: connections and their structural and spatial diversity (Shannon's formula). Using graph theory techniques we identified interregional clusters of the Northern Periphery: Tyumen (Tyumen) and Siberian (Tomsk). Subsequent verification was carried out by analysis of publications and organizations? patent activity. The research shows that arctic regions are actively included in network with universities and science centers, serving as the main consumers of new technologies. Russian innovation space can be described by core-periphery model: the largest cities, located in the main strip of settlement, are the centers for generation and diffusion of innovation on the northern periphery. Emerging innovation clusters in the sphere of environmental management coincide with territorial structure of existing innovation space, but with significant northern bias. The study shows high innovation capacity of northern organizations in applying of new technologies."

      "Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are one of the most influential financial innovations, reshaping the investment funds market in many countries, including Mexico. Due to their similar investment objectives, ETFs are considered substitutes for mutual funds. This paper examines the changes of the investment funds (ETFs and mutual funds) in Mexico over 2002-2012 using a category of the innovation diffusion models, i.e. logistic growth models in order to explore the key development patterns. Descriptions of the selected categories of investment funds are provided in the first section of the article, together with the advantages of ETFs as opposed to mutual funds. Next section presents data sources and methodological framework, with detailed description of the innovation diffusion models applied in the research (based on 3-parametric logistic curve). Sum of assets under management of ETFs and mutual is considered as the size of the total investment funds market. Empirical findings indicate the significant development of the ETF market, both in terms of assets under management and market share. According to the presented estimations, Mexican ETF market development can be described with the logistic growth models, and three characteristic phases of the logistic curve were clearly observable. Predicted ETF market development patterns point towards further increase of market share of ETFs over the next 3-5 years yet the probability of exceeding the level of ca. 20-30% seems low"

      "Im Kontext großflächiger Kommodifizierung von Land in Subsahara-Afrika - kritisch als land grabbing bezeichnet - kommt es vermehrt zu Konflikten. In vielen Fällen sind traditionelle Autoritäten zentrale Konfliktakteure. Während sich zahlreiche Studien mit traditionellen Autoritäten als Mediatoren und Konfliktschlichtern befassen, thematisieren wenige die Rolle traditioneller Autoritäten als beteiligte Konfliktakteure. Hiermit befasst sich dieses Working Paper anhand einer Fallstudie zu Konflikten um das agrarindustrielle Projekt ScanFarm in Ghana. Ich gehe der Frage nach, inwiefern die Macht traditioneller Autoritäten von Bedeutung für die Entstehung und den Verlauf von Konflikten um land grabbing ist. Dafür analysiere ich das Handeln traditioneller Autoritäten in Konflikten um Land mithilfe von Steven Lukes (1974, 2005) Konzept der sichtbaren, unsichtbaren und internalisierten Macht. Die Gruppe traditioneller Autoritäten, die für die Verwaltung von Land zuständig sind, ist durch Heterogenität und Hierarchien gekennzeichnet. Ich argumentiere, dass diese Hierarchien für die alltägliche Landnutzungspraxis zwar bedeutungslos sind, in Konflikten um land grabbing jedoch relevant werden. Die auf diesen Hierarchien beruhenden Machtverhältnisse bestimmen in Konflikten um land grabbing, wer über die Fähigkeit verfügt territoriale Kontrolle auszuüben. Das Zusammenspiel der drei von Lukes vorgeschlagenen Machtdimensionen bestimmt diese Fähigkeit maßgeblich.",
      "In the context of large-scale commodification of land in sub-Sahara Africa - critically referred to as land grabbing - social conflicts have increased. In many of these conflicts, traditional authorities are central actors. Whereas a number of studies deals with traditional authorities as mediators and arbitrators in conflicts, the role of traditional authorities as conflict actors is hardly considered. In this paper, I address this gap. By referring to a conflict around the agro-industrial ScanFarm project in Ghana, I examine the relevance of traditional authorities' power for the emergence and course of conflicts over land grabbing. Using Steven Lukes' (1974, 2005) concept of visible, hidden and internalized power I analyze the actions of traditional authorities in conflicts over land grabbing and demonstrate the heterogeneity and hierarchic structure of the group of traditional authorities responsible for the management of lands. I argue that existing hierarchies are insignificant for everyday land use practices but become relevant in conflicts over land grabbing. Power structures resulting from these hierarchies influence who is able to carry out territorial control, which in turn is crucial when it comes to conflicts over land. The interplay of Lukes' three dimensions of power considerably shape this ability."

      "This paper reports results from controlled laboratory experiments on the Laffer curve and explores the productivity differences under the strategy method and the direct method. The data collected in Pakistan show no significant productivity difference across the two methods. The paper argues that the Laffer curve is not the result of a simple leisure-income tradeoff; the disutility of work and perceived unfairness of the tax imposed also influence the work decisions. A behavioral model that incorporates these factors induces a 'fairness adjusted' Laffer curve with the negative relationship between tax rate and tax revenue showing up after 54% tax rate."

      "We examine the inter-relationships among employee-friendly policies (EFP), innovation through R&D investment, and firm value. We hypothesize that firms with higher levels of innovation and entrepreneurial spirit are more likely to utilize EFP. Furthermore, we speculate that the value-EFP association is more pronounced in firms with high R&D intensity. Consistent with these assertions, we find that EFP is significantly and positively related to R&D investment and the number of patents. EFP is also associated with increased firm value at high levels of R&D investment and high numbers of patents. Furthermore, we find that firms investing more in R&D are more likely to treat their workers favorably and that markets react positively when such firms are recognized for their favorable treatment of employees. Our analysis, based on a large sample of U.S.-based firms and two different measures of employee-friendly policies, supports the assertion that EFP based on sustainable innovation and entrepreneurial mindsets contributes to value creation"

      "This study examines interdependencies between investments of equity crowdfunders. Based on hand-collected data from a well-established equitycrowdfunding platform, we find strong indication that investors observe previous investments to determine their willingness to pay for equity shares. Furthermore, the investment behavior of predecessors may lead investors to deviate from average investment behavior. In particular, investors are willing to pay more than the average investment, when the focal campaign is hot or there have been many large investments in the campaign. Remarkably, a high number of all previous investments over the entire period of the campaign as well as co-financing by presumably sophisticated investors negatively influence willingness to pay. This suggests that crowd investors are subject to partial crowding-out. These findings are different on the platform level, which suggests that investors' behavior is rather information than sentiment-driven."

Seit einigen Jahren nutzen Ökonomen allerdings die Erfahrungen der Psychologie mit stilisierten Experimenten, um zumindest ihre grundlegenden Verhaltenshypothesen testen zu können. Dieser Beitrag stellt ein einfaches Hörsaal-Experiment vor, das Adam Smiths Hypothese von der \"unsichtbaren Hand\" im Marktgeschehen empirisch überprüft. Das Experiment zeigt zudem, wie Wettbewerb als Entdeckungsverfahren funktioniert, und besitzt hohen didaktischen Wert: Die Studenten erhalten Einblick in empirische Forschung und erleben hautnah das Funktionieren des Marktes.",
      "In Economics, like in any social science, empirical tests of theoretical results face the problem that the economy cannot be reproduced in laboratories. Drawing on the experience of Psychology, Experimental Economics nowadays uses stylised experiments to test at least the basic assumptions of the economic theory of human behavior. This paper describes a simple classroom experiment that serves as an empiricial test of Adam Smith's invisible- hand hypothesis. It demonstrates that competition acts as a discovery procedure. The experiment is of high didactical value, since the students gain insights into empirical research and experience how markets work."

      "The purpose of this paper is to ascertain the level of CSR reporting of the top multinational hotel groups in Mauritius. Content analysis method is used to identify the social responsibility patterns found in their annual reports. This study thus investigates the level and the reasons for CSR disclosure of multinational groups in the hospitality sector in Mauritius through a review of their annual reports. The aim is to explore the possibility of using the legitimacy theory as a plausible explanation for CSR reporting practices by multinational hotel groups in the context of a developing country. Mauritius proves to be an interesting case study as the hotel industry is one of the main engines of growth and the country is also actively trying to attract foreign investors in terms of FDI and multinational enterprises (MNEs). Furthermore, the country has also made it mandatory for profit making entities to devote 2% of their book profits to CSR activities since 2009. The annual reports of 6 hotel groups have been analysed using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indicators. The study shows that CSR reporting is prevalent among all the hotel groups in the sample but there is no primary area of CSR focus in the sector. The emphasis placed on CSR also varies significantly. Furthermore, the majority of the CSR information tend to relate to particular categories showing that the hotel groups take a narrow view of CSR and tend to prioritise particular areas at the expense of others. The findings also suggest that the disclosures tend to have a public-relations bias, with 'good news' type of disclosures being mostly dominant while 'bad news' disclosures tend to be minimal. The findings thus provide some support for legitimacy theory in explaining CSR disclosures."

      "National development banks (NDBs) have huge potential to support their country's development strategies and the transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient economies. However, a perception of problematic governance and weak performance means that these banks may be overlooked, both in terms of their potential role in supporting national development, and as partners for international development finance institutions, international climate funds, donors and private actors. This perception is especially strong for African NDBs. Many operate in contexts of institutional weakness and problematic governance, presenting challenges both to the autonomy of NDBs from political interests, and the capacity of these institutions to fulfil their mandates. This study explores whether these negative perceptions of governance and financial performance are valid, and examines the extent to which the governance of NDBs in Africa affects their financial performance. Combining quantitative and descriptive analysis based on a novel time-series dataset of 33 banks in 21 countries, we explore the governance and financial trends that characterise these banks over the period 2014 to 2019, and use an econometric analysis to measure the specific impact of political influence on governance, and the financial performance of banks."

      "Over the next 50 years, New Zealand's population will age substantially. There has been wide debate about whether New Zealand should prepare for population ageing by increasing national savings. The debate had not, however, involved explicit consideration of possible time paths for savings, consumption, debt, and other relevant macroeconomic variables; nor have explicit principles been offered for determining which of these time paths are to be preferred. This paper addresses the question of choosing time paths through the use of a Ramsey-Solow model of optimal saving, adapted for investigating problems of population ageing. The results suggest that population ageing alone would not justify increases in national savings rates beyond those envisaged by current policy. The cost of ageing in terms of reduced real consumption is not large enough to justify large additional savings beyond those currently predicted, and the concomitant reduction in current consumption. The findings concerning national savings and living standards are robust to a variety of specifications of demographic conditions, interest rates, and productivity growth."

      "In many cases, the expected efficiency advantages of public-private partnership (PPP) projects as a specific form of infrastructure provision did not materialize ex post. From a Public Choice perspective, one simple explanation for many of the problems surrounding the governance of PPPs is that the public decision-makers being involved in the process of initiating and implementing PPP projects (namely, politicians and public bureaucrats) in many situations make low-cost decisions in the sense of Kirchgässner. That is, their decisions may have a high impact on the wealth of the jurisdiction in which the PPP is located (most notably, on the welfare of citizen-taxpayers in this jurisdiction) but, at the same time, these decisions often only have a low impact on the private welfare of the individual decision-makers in politics and bureaucracies. The latter, for example, in many settings often have a low economic incentive to monitor/control what the private sector partners are doing (or not doing) within a PPP arrangement. The purpose of this paper is to draw greater attention to the problems created by low-cost decisions for the governance of PPPs. Moreover, the paper discusses potential remedies arising from the viewpoint of Public Choice and constitutional political economy."

      "We study the empirical relationship between labor taxation and pretax wages in Italy. We find that higher tax progressivity increases pretax wages. To explain this result, we introduce in an informal way a relative wage effect and argue that the combination of this effect with the labor supply effect dominates the wage moderation effect. We find also evidence that changes in payroll taxes are not fully absorbed by offsetting changes in the pretax wage and affect labor costs and employment. The evidence on the effect of the average income tax rate on pretax wages is more mixed, but it also points to the presence of some degree of real wage resistance. Finally, we find significant differences in the relationship between labor taxes and pretax wages by age group but not by skill or region of residence."

      "Die globale Wirtschaftskrise führt zu einem massiven Anstieg der Arbeitslosigkeit, und fast alle Regierungen haben die Sicherung der heimischen Beschäftigung zu einem zentralen Ziel ihrer Wirtschaftspolitik erklärt. In den USA wurde sofort nach dem Amtsantritt von Präsident Obama ein weiteres Konjunkturpaket in Höhe von rund 790 Milliarden US-Dollar beschlossen. Teil dieses Programms ist eine \"Buy-American-Klausel\", die bei öffentlichen Aufträgen heimische gegenüber ausländischen Anbietern bevorzugen soll. Dies führt zu Gegenmaßnahmen anderer Länder. In einigen Fällen kam es bereits zu Zollerhöhungen und handelsverzerrenden Währungsabwertungen. Es droht ein Protektionismuswettlauf, der dramatische Folgen für den Welthandel und die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung aller Länder haben kann. In der globalen Krise besteht daher das Gebot der Stunde: Multilaterale Organisationen stärken. Das DIW Berlin schlägt eine Reform des internationalen Währungsfonds vor. Darüber hinaus sollte die G-20-Gruppe eine größere Rolle bei der Bekämpfung internationaler Finanzkrisen spielen. Die EU-Länder sollten künftig dort nur noch mit einem gemeinsamen Vertreter auftreten."

      "Since the summer of 2007, participants in financial markets have been confronted by a crisis of their own making. In order to prevent the recurrence of a similar crisis in the future, the G-20 nations, at their finance summit in Washington on 15 November 2008, resolved to \"ensure that all financial markets, products and participants are regulated or subject to oversight, as appropriate to their circumstances.\" However, the elimination of loopholes as a matter of principle does not in itself provide a roadmap for the reconfiguration of financial markets. DIW Berlin is promoting an agenda of nine principles for regulatory reform. Item 1 through 3 focus on the prevention of coordination failures at the micro and the macro level as well as establishing appropriate incentives front and center; item 4 through 6 sketch out opportunities and limits for the future role of government; item 7 and 8 focus on oversight. Finally, item 9 calls for a stronger emphasis on equity financing and makes an appeal for the insight that financing constraints based upon credit worthiness ultimately serve to protect the financial system."

      "Using a model of dynamic price competition, this paper provides an explanation from the supply side for the well-established observation that retail prices adjust faster when input costs rise than when they fall. The opportunity of profitable storing for the next period induces competitive firms to immediately increase their prices in anticipation of higher future input costs. This relaxes competition and firms earn positive profits. Conversely, when input costs are expected to decline, firms adjust their prices only after a cost reduction materializes, and the firms' incentives for price undercutting lead to the standard Bertrand outcome."

      "This paper uses new data on Swedish national wealth over a period of two hundred years to study whether the patterns in wealth-income ratios previously found by Piketty and Zucman (2014) for some very rich and large Western economies extend to smaller countries that were historically backward and developed a different set of political and economic institutions during the twentieth century. The findings point to both similarities and differences. In the pre-industrial era, Sweden had much lower wealth levels than the rest of Europe, and the main explanation is that the Swedes were too poor to save their income. Over the twentieth century, Swedish aggregate trends and levels are much more similar to those of the rest of Europe, but the structure of national wealth differs. In Sweden, government wealth grew much faster and became more important, not least through its relatively large public pension system. This suggests an explicit role of historical economic and political institutions for the long-run evolution of wealth-income ratios."

      "In diesem Discussion Paper wird im ersten Teil das Forschungsprogramm der Abteilung Kulturelle Quellen von Neuheit dokumentiert, im zweiten Teil werden insgesamt sechs Projekte und zwei an das Programm gekoppelte Dissertationen vorgestellt. Neuheit, so die zugrundeliegende Annahme des Forschungsprogramms, bildet den Kern von Innovationen und entsteht in mehrfach bestimmten kulturellen Zusammenhängen, die als kulturelle Quellen bezeichnet werden. Die Relevanz dieser kulturellen Faktoren - im Unterschied zu technischen oder politischen Aspekten - ist der Gegenstand der Forschung. Dabei gelten drei Prozesse als entscheidend für die Qualität und Anschlussfähigkeit von Innovationen: 1) die ständige Variation kultureller Selbstverständlichkeiten, 2) Prozesse der Bewertung als Neuheit und 3) Spannungszustände, die in und zwischen Kulturen auftreten. Das Zusammenspiel dieser drei Prozesse, so die These, bestimmt das Spektrum und die Reichweite des Neuen, das sich langfristig durchsetzt. Die empirischen Felder des Forschungsprogramms sind aus der räumlichen, interaktiven und zeitlichen Dimensionierung kultureller Konfigurationen hergeleitet. In jedem der Felder sind zwei Projekte angesiedelt, die Phänomene unterschiedlicher Größenordnung untersuchen.",
      "The discussion paper develops, in its first part, the research program of the unit. The second part of the paper presents six projects, as well as two dissertations linked to the program. It is assumed that newness is at the core of innovations and emerges in cultural configurations which are identified as cultural sources. The relevance of such cultural factors, as opposed to the influence of technical or political aspects, is the focus of research. Three kinds of processes determine the quality and the connectivity of innovations: 1) the continuous variation of shared cultural semantics and practices, 2) processes of evaluating newness and 2) states of tension in and between cultures. The interplay of these three processes, it is argued, determines the spectrum and the spread of successful innovations. The empirical streams of the research program are deduced from the spatial, interactive and temporal dimension of cultural configurations. In each stream, two projects are located, focused on different orders of magnitude."

      "This paper maps the use of digital tools in the Icelandic constitutional revision process of 2011 and discusses its aftermath in subsequent years. Although causal links between the digital elements of the process and the content and fate of the constitutional bill are impossible to establish, an analysis of the Icelandic constitution-writing efforts as ‘digital democracy’ reveals some important lessons. High-quality input into constitution-making processes through digital participation is possible, but the very threat of this to vested institutional interests also makes consensus on and enforcement of the ‘rules of the game’ of paramount importance."

      "In der Kommissionierung werden anstelle von Papierlisten (Pick-by-Paper) zunehmend digitale Assistenzsysteme (AS) eingesetzt. Hierzu gehören vernetzte Armbanduhren zur Weitergabe von Auftragsdaten an das Personal während es sich im Lager bewegt, um Produkte zu entnehmen (Pick-by-Watch [PbW]). Bislang hat die Forschung sich auf die ergonomische und technische Gestaltung von PbW-Systemen sowie ihre Leistung relativ zu anderen AS konzentriert. Kaum analysiert wurde, ob individuelle Merkmale von Kommissionierern (z. B. Alter) systematische Zusammenhänge mit Leistungsaspekten von AS aufweisen und solche Assoziationen bei verschiedenen AS voneinander abweichen. Ziel der vorliegenden Studie ist es deshalb, Korrelationen zwischen individuellen Merkmalen von Kommissionierern einerseits und Kommissionierleistungskriterien andererseits bei Verwendung eines PbW-Systems oder herkömmlicher Papierlisten empirisch zu bestimmen. Hierzu wurde ein Laborexperiment mit 55 Teilnehmern durchgeführt, für die fünf Dimensionen von Kommissionierleistungen jeweils für ein PbW-AS sowie Papierlisten und fünf personenbezogene Merkmale gemessen wurden. Die empirischen Befunde erweitern den Kenntnisstand zu Spielräumen und Grenzen der Leistungsbeeinflussung in der Kommissionierung durch Einarbeitungs- und Auswahlmaßnahmen, die auf soziodemographische und tätigkeitsbezogene Erfahrungsmerkmale der Aufgabenträger Bezug nehmen."

      "This groundbreaking handbook leads the way in accelerating the transition to a sustainable circular economy by introducing the concept of a catalyst as a positive and enhancing driving force for sustainability. Catalysts create and maintain favourable conditions for complex systemic sustainability transition changes, and a discussion and understanding of catalysts is required to move from a linear economy to a sustainable and circular economy. With contributions from leading experts from around the globe, this volume presents theoretical insights, contextualised case studies, and participatory methodologies, which identify different catalysts, including technology, innovation, business models, management and organisation, regulation, sustainability policy, product design, and culture. The authors then show how these catalysts accelerate sustainability transitions. As a unique value to the reader, the book brings together public policy and private business perspectives to address the circular economy as a systemic change. Its theoretical and practical perspectives are coupled with real-world case studies from Finland, Italy, China, India, Nigeria, and others to provide tangible insights on catalysing the circular economy across organisational, hierarchical, and disciplinary boundaries. With its broad interdisciplinary and geographically diverse scope, this handbook will be a valuable tool for researchers, academics, and policy-makers in the fields of circular economy, sustainability transitions, environmental studies, business, and the social sciences more broadly."

      "Comprehensive numerical models are pivotal to analyze the decarbonization of electricity systems. However, increasing system complexity and limited computational resources impose restrictions to model-based analyses. One way to reduce computational burden is to use a minimum, yet representative, set of system states for model simulation. These states characterize fluctuating renewable generation and variable demand for electricity prevailing at a certain point in time. A review of possible time series aggregation techniques identifies cluster algorithms as most adequate, with k-Means and the Ward algorithm predominating. However, throughout the surveyed literature, the line of reasoning for the selection of these algorithms remains unclear. To support the electricity system modeling community in selecting an algorithm, this paper devises a systematic multi-stage evaluation approach to compare a large variety of cluster analysis configurations, differing in algorithm, cluster representation, and number of clusters. Results show that electricity demand and renewable energy generation time series can be compressed to below one percent while sustaining global characteristics of the original data. Two potent cluster configurations are identified, confirming k-Means and WARD as being prevalent. Beyond electricity market data, the methodology can be applied to various types of fundamental time-dependent input data."

      "We examined the effect of institutional quality and firm-specific factors on corporate investment in Nigeria using fifty-four (54) quoted non-financial firms within the period of 2002-2012. We applied dynamic panel estimator proposed by Arellano-Bond (1991). The results showed that regulatory quality, corruption, political stability and control of corruption have insignificant effect in determining corporate investments in Nigeria. Our results also confirmed that firms' firm-specific factors influenced corporate investment in Nigeria. While firms' cash flow displayed positive and significant effect on investment other factors had negative effects on investment.Our results showed that investment is constrained to internally generated fund, despite the existence of capital market. In addition, the spillover effect of tightening monetary policy during the period of study had increased the cost of borrowing thereby having a negative effect on investment in the real sector. We recommended that when the monetary authorities are focusing on inflation targeting, they should also not lose sight of its impact on corporate investment and other productivity growth of firms; which is the source of long term sustainable growth and development of economies."

      "Unemployment insurance is usually found to show negative effects in the transition from unemployment to a new job. However, the extent to which workers' careers might improve or deteriorate as a result of the unemployment insurance system is not immediately clear. This paper addresses the effects of certain aspects of this system on employment stability by jointly accounting for benefits endogeneity, dynamic selection issues and occurrence dependence. The analysis is undertaken for a dual labour market, such as the market in Spain, where temporary and permanent workers differ with respect to numerous individual and labour market characteristics. We find that non-insured unemployed workers experience a greater rate of transition to employment than insured workers. But we also find that benefits encourage job stability for temporary workers not only by increasing subsequent job tenure but also by increasing the probability of entering into a permanent contract. Finally, we get that shortening the duration of the benefit entitlement period does not seem to lead to significant gains in overall employment stability, which increases at most by 4.3 %."

      "This article investigates and empirically tests the link between climate change and sovereign risk in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asian countries are among those most heavily affected by climate change. The number and intensity of extreme weather events in the region have been increasing markedly, causing severe social and economic damage. Southeast Asian economies are also exposed to gradual effects of global warming as well as transition risks stemming from policies aimed at mitigating climate change. To empirically examine the effect of climate change on the sovereign risk of Southeast Asian countries, we employ indices for vulnerability and resilience to climate change and estimate country-specific OLS models for six countries and a fixed-effects panel using monthly data for the period 2002-2018. Both the country-specific and the panel results show that greater climate vulnerability appears to have a sizable positive effect on sovereign bond yields, while greater resilience to climate change has an offsetting effect, albeit to a lesser extent. A higher cost of debt holds back much-needed investment in public infrastructure and climate adaptation, increases the risk of debt sustainability problems, and diminishes the development prospects of Southeast Asian countries."

      "Regulating an export firm (or a homogeneous industry) with private information about emission technology is analysed, when the firm, owned partly by foreigners, has an option to bypass domestic regulation through costly relocation. If the firm chooses to relocate, it will set up a new plant in a region practicing environmental dumping, at a cost that is correlated with emission efficiency, so as to make the firm’s reservation utility type-dependent. We characterise the set of optimal contracts offered by the uninformed, domestic government under different ownership structures, when domestic taxation is distortive, and when welfare is the sum of consumers’ surplus and the share of the firm’s rent accruing to domestic residents. With complete information, ownership has no real effects. When information is incomplete, ownership matters, due to rent extraction, being of greater significance when ownership rights are shifted towards foreigners. Rent extraction is accomplished by offering contracts with lower output and higher net emissions to a subset of the most efficient types (being induced to stay), whereas a subset of the least efficient types should be induced to relocate. A demand for environmental dumping is being induced by the domestic government’s concern for national interests. When barriers towards foreign ownership are lowered, and then shifting the distribution of ownership rights in the favour of foreigners, more pollution will be generated for types of the firm that do not exit, whereas a larger fraction of the firm types should be induced to relocate."

      "Most studies of the ethnic composition of destination neighbourhoods after residential moves do not take into account the types of moves people have made. However, from an individual perspective, different types of moves may result in neighbourhood environments that differ in terms of their ethnic composition from those in which individuals previously lived. We investigate how the ethnic residential context changes for individuals as a result of different types of mobility (immobility, intra-urban mobility, suburbanisation, and long-distance migration) for residents of the segregated post-Soviet city of Tallinn. We compare the extent to which Estonian- and Russian-speakers integrate in residential terms. Using unique longitudinal Census data (2000-2011) we tracked changes in the individual ethnic residential context of both groups. We found that the moving destinations of Estonian- and Russian-speakers diverge. When Estonians move, their new neighbourhood generally possesses a lower percentage of Russian-speakers compared with when Russian-speakers move, as well as compared with their previous neighbourhoods. For Russian-speakers, the percentage of other Russian-speakers in their residential surroundings decreases only for those who move to the surburbs or who move over longer distances to rural villages. By applying a novel approach of tracking the changes in the ethnic residential context of individuals for all mobility types, we were able to demonstrate that the two largest ethnolinguistic groups in Estonia tend to behave as 'parallel populations' and that residential integration in Estonia is therefore slow."

      "In this paper the author formulates and tests an international intertemporal capital asset pricing model in the presence of deviations from purchasing power parity (II-CAPM [PPP]). He finds evidence in favor of at least mild segmentation of international equity markets in which only global market risk appears to be priced. When using the Hansen & Jagannathan (1991, 1997) variance bounds and distance measures as testing devices, the author finds that, while all international asset pricing models are formally rejected by the data, their pricing implications are substantially different. The superior performance of the II-CAPM (PPP) is mainly attributable to significant hedging against inflation risk."

      "This paper analyses data from a large‐scale survey on corporate action to support biodiversity and ecosystem services undertaken by firms of all sizes and across manufacturing industries. The analysis focuses on Germany as the largest economy by GDP in the European Union and analyses the uptake of activities directly aimed at protecting biodiversity and ecosystem services compared to the uptake of other environmental protection activities. It furthermore investigates how activity and tool adoption as well as risk assessments vary with firm size and across industries, and with implementing environmental management systems. The analysis finds tensions between risk perception and activities pursued for biodiversity protection, largely because firms shy away from substantive action. It reveals that smaller and medium‐sized firms are less active and that environmental management systems are not conducive to corporate activities in support of biodiversity and ecosystem services."

      "The Honduran PRAF experiment randomly assigned conditional cash transfers to 40 of 70 poor municipalities, within five strata defined by a poverty proxy. Using census data, we show that eligible children were 8 percentage points more likely to enroll in school and 3 percentage points less likely to work. The effects were much larger in the two poorest strata, and statistically insignificant in the other three (the latter finding is robust to the use of a separate regression-discontinuity design). Heterogeneity confirms the importance of judicious targeting to maximize the impact and cost-effectiveness of CCTs. There is no consistent evidence of effects on ineligible children or on adult labor supply."

      "This paper analyzes how Japan financed its World War II occupation of Southeast Asia, the transfer of resources to Japan, and the monetary and inflation consequences of Japanese policies. In Malaya, Burma, Indonesia and the Philippines, the issue of military scrip to pay for resources and occupying armies greatly increased money supply. Despite high inflation, hyperinflation hardly occurred because of a sustained transactions demand for money, because of Japan's strong enforcement of monetary monopoly, and because of declining Japanese military capability to ship resources home. In Thailand and Indochina, occupation costs and bilateral clearing arrangements created near open-ended Japanese purchasing power and allowed the transfer to Japan of as much as a third of Indochina's annual GDP. Although the Thai and Indochinese governments financed Japanese demands mainly by printing large quantities of money, inflation rose only in line with monetary expansion due to money's continued use as a store of value in rice-surplus areas."

      "We analyze short-term effects of free hospitalization insurance for the poorest quintile of the population in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. First, we exploit that eligibility is based on an exogenous poverty score threshold and apply a regression discontinuity design. Second, we exploit imperfect rollout and compare insured and uninsured households using propensity score matching. With both methods we fail to detect significant effects on the incidence of hospitalization. Whereas the program did not meaningfully increase the quantity of health care consumed, insured households more often choose private hospitals, indicating a shift towards higher perceived quality of care."

      "We analyze changes in the willingness to substitute from prescribed pharmaceuticals to more affordable generic equivalents in response to the first experience with a substitution. Using Swedish individual-level data of prescribed and dispensed pharmaceuticals, we employ a dynamic event study and an instrumental variable approach to show that an initial substitution reduces the probability of opposing subsequent substitutions by 39 percentage points. The impact of a first substitution is especially large among elderly patients. We recommend that policy-makers target patients with a history of opposed substitution and offer additional discounts to promote substitution as long-term savings outweigh one-time costs."

      "We study how the Indian government bond market functions, how it has changed over time, and what factors help explain some of its features. Looking at the primary market, we describe how underwriting obligations are allocated to primary dealers via auction and identify several significant determinants of the underwriting commission cutoff rate, including the launch of the Negotiated Dealing System-Order Matching System (NDS-OM) electronic trading platform. Turning to the secondary market, we explore the importance of benchmark bonds, the launch of NDS-OM, the growth in trading activity, and the migration of activity from the over-the-counter (OTC) market to NDS-OM. We find that benchmark bonds, larger issues, and recently issued bonds tend to trade more actively, but that the launch of NDS-OM is associated with a reduced likelihood of a bond trading but greater trading volume conditional on trading. Benchmark bonds, larger issues, and recently issued bonds are associated with a greater share of NDS-OM trading volume (as opposed to OTC trading volume), suggesting that the NDS-OM platform is especially attractive for trading bonds with benchmark attributes."

      "Searching for possible viable economic pathways for small-scale farms in Eastern Europe, this study is concerned with Community Supported Agriculture (CSA). We are mainly interested in the costs and benefits for both sides, the farmers and the consumers, when entering into a direct, trust-based market relationship in the form of CSA. The study is theoretically embedded in the concept of solidarity economy. The analysis is based on three cases of farmers pioneering the CSA concept in Romania by offering organic vegetable to their local contracted consumers in the Western part of the country. All three CSA groups were initiated by a local NGO. Our empirical results shed light on CSA partnerships in Romania. With regard to consumers we find that they are drawn from a specific group of urban dwellers with higher education and income, and a particular interest in health and nutrition. Consumers show a high level of trust to their partner farmers: this is the basis for a functioning economic relationship. Solidarity is a value that is aspired by the initiating NGO. It is existing as one of the values sought by consumers when taking part in CSA. More important than solidarity is, however, the consumers' wish for organic-quality fresh products, which are not available elsewhere. On the producers´ side, the need for a stable market with fair prices is the main motivation to get involved in CSA. Thus, both farmers and consumer compensate for market failures through the CSA partnership.",
      "Diese Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit dem Phänomen der Solidarischen Landwirtschaft, welche einen möglichen Ausweg aus der schwierigen Situation für Kleinbetriebe in Osteuropa bieten könnte. Der Schwerpunkt des Interesses liegt auf den Kosten und dem Nutzen für die Akteure - Landwirte und ihre Konsumenten - wenn diese eine auf Vertrauen basierte Marktbeziehung in Form der Solidarischen Landwirtschaft eingehen. Die Studie ist theoretisch in das Konzept der Solidarischen Ökonomie eingebettet. Die Analyse basiert auf drei Fallstudien rumänischer Kleinbetriebe, die als Pioniere das Konzept der Solidarischen Landwirtschaft in Rumänien anwenden, indem sie Gemüse ökologisch anbauen, und an ihre urbanen Vertragspartner liefern. In allen drei Fällen war eine lokale Nichtregierungsorganisation Initiator. Unsere empirischen Ergebnisse geben Einblick in rumänischen Partnerschaften der Solidarischen Landwirtschaft. Die Konsumenten rekrutieren sich aus einer spezifischen Gruppe urbaner Verbraucher. Diese zeichnet sich durch relativ hohe Bildung und Einkommen sowie ihr ausgeprägtes Interesse an Gesundheits- und Ernährungsfragen aus. Die Verbraucher zeigen einen hohen Grad an Vertrauen in ihre landwirtschaftlichen Vertragspartner, was wohl als einer der Schlüsselfaktoren für das Funktionieren der Partnerschaft gesehen werden kann. Solidarität stand im Mittelpunkt des Interesses der initiierenden Organisation. In der praktischen Umsetzung zeigt sich, dass Solidarität in der Tat einer der Werte ist, den die teilnehm enden Konsumenten realisieren wollen. Gewichtiger ist allerdings der Wunsch nach frischen Nahrungsmitteln aus ökologischer Landwirtschaft, die sonst kaum auf dem Markt zu erhalten sind. Die Motivation der Produzenten liegt vornehmlich in dem Wunsch begründet, einen stabilen Absatzmarkt mit fairen Preisen zu betreten. Beide Seiten kompensieren also durch die Partnerschaft bestehendes Marktversagen."

      "The amendment of the existing excise tax law on tobacco and alcoholic products is the only revenue measure that the Aquino administration has certified as urgent to date. This paper reviews and evaluates the different versions of both houses of the sin tax reform measure. Republic Act (RA) 10351, otherwise known as the Sin Tax Reform 2012, appears to have successfully put together the desirable provisions of the House and Senate version. RA 10351 not only simplifies tax administration and increases tax revenues, but also eliminates the preferential tax treatment given to existing brands by doing away with the freeze in price classification. However, earmarking of the incremental revenues, despite arguments against it, continues to be one of its major features."

      "Fossil fuels as the main energy source of every country now predicted will be ended no more than 40 years. Therefore, alternative fuel such as biofuel has been developed by many countries including Indonesia. Indonesia as one of the highest populated country and has wide areas of agriculture, forest and crop field is potential to be the highest biofuel production in the world. However, after one decade since the Government of Indonesia launched the energy Policy in 2006, appears to be interesting that the biofuels progress in Indonesia seen not well developed. One of the basic weaknesses is the program only applied to the specific area with a high biofuel resource by central government without support by local government. Furthermore, the target of biofuel programs seems to be very high or too ambitious, while the condition of the people still very traditional which can be seen from the lifestyle and their energy consumption. This paper provides in detail a review of several topics related to resource, energy consumption, policy and the research and development activities of biofuel in Indonesia. As a discussion, some recommendation provided to encourage the biofuel development in the near future."

      "In view of the major methodological challenges which confront researchers in public diplomacy (PD), the paper recognizes the method of comparative-historical analysis (CHA) as an eminently suitable approach for robust empirical studies. The paper starts by exploring different conceptualizations and operationalizations of public diplomacy. Subsequently, four defining characteristics of CHA are identified: (1) CHA starts from a positivist epistemological perspective; (2) CHA-based research usually is concerned with \"big questions;\" (3) comparative methods are applied in CHA, either across different cases or within cases across time, allowing for in-depth analyses; (4) by considering respective starting points, specific historical developments, and cultural particulars, CHA is committed to methods drawn from historical research, including process tracing and causal narrative. The paper demonstrates that CHA, in view of these characteristics and with its highly interdisciplinary pedigree and methodological eclecticism, is eminently suited for studies exploring PD practices and outcomes. To provide a tailor-made approach for such endeavors, CHA is innovatively combined with the method of structured, focused comparison. Finally, drawing on both the different operationalizations of PD and the requirements of CHA, a comprehensive matrix for CHA-based PD research is presented, offering a tangible framework for future empirical analyses."

      "The paper analyzes Australian exchange rate and its determinants by providing an insight into the economic and non-economic factors. By drawing a comparison between quarterly and annual data over the period of 1975 to 2012, it is suggested that Australia’s trade components and macroeconomic indicators such as output and liquidity relative to the US, play a significant role in determination of its exchange rates. However, interest rate and inflation appear insignificant in this relationship. The study also emphasizes on the pertinence of unobservable effects such as political events and external shocks in influencing the exchange rate. Engle-Granger Cointegration test exhibits a long run relationship between exchange rate and its determinants, and corroborates the substantial role of macroeconomic indicators in diminishing the uncertainty in foreign exchange market."

      "In the context of an autoregressive panel data model with fixed effect, we examine the relationship between consistent parameter estimation and consistent model selection. Consistency in parameter estimation is achieved by using the tansformation of the fixed effect proposed by Lancaster (2002). We find that such transformation does not necessarily lead to consistent estimation of the autoregressive coefficient when the wrong set of exogenous regressors are included. To estimate our model consistently and to measure its goodness of fit, we argue for comparing different model specifications using the Bayes factor rather than the Bayesian information criterion based on the biased maximum likelihood estimates. When the model uncertainty is substantial, we recommend the use of Bayesian Model Averaging. Finally, we apply our method to study the relationship between financial development and economic growth. Our findings reveal that stock market development is positively related to economic growth, while the effect of bank development is not as significant as the classical literature suggests."

      "This paper examines whether the presence of refugees alters the intra-household allocation of tasks across genders in the hosting population. Using panel data (pre- and post-refugee inflow) from Kagera, a rural region of Tanzania, we find that the refugee shock led to women being less likely to engage in employment outside the household and more likely to engage in household chores relative to men. This is probably the result of the environmental degradation that accompanied the arrival of refugees and the additional competition for natural resources such as wood and water. However, the results differ by (pre-shock) literacy and maths skill. For women who could read and perform simple written mathematical operations the refugee shock resulted in a higher likelihood of engaging in outside employment. On the other hand, higher exposure to the refugee shock resulted in illiterate women being more likely to engage in farming and household chores."

      "The current Energy Market is not yet ready for the integration of the Smart Grid context. Concepts such as Demand Response and Distributed Generation, namely renewable energy resources, are not yet included in current business models in order to the system flow properly. Therefore, the authors propose a methodology that gathers all these concepts through the optimization, aggregation and remuneration of resources. The purpose of this paper will be to study the influence of the tariff used for the remuneration and incentive of the participants in the formation of the groups in the aggregation phase. Three studies were performed: aggregation with only the result of the optimization (schedule power for each resource); this result and the fixed tariff associated with each resource; result and a new tariff that considers real-time values."

We analyze the tradeoffs between the safety and convenience of aggregating balances in addresses, electronic wallets and banks. In our model, agents balance the risk of theft of a large account with the cost to safeguarding a large number of passwords for many small accounts. Account custodians (banks, wallets and other payment service providers) have different objectives and trade-offs along these dimensions; we analyze the welfare effects of differing industry structures and interdependencies. In particular, we examine, the consequences of \"password aggregation\" programs, which, in effect, consolidate risks across accounts."

      "This paper presents evidence on household savings in urban regions of the Chinese provinces Sichuan and Liaoning based on data from the State Statistical Bureau's Urban Household Survey for the late 1980s. In this period the Chinese economy was subject to extensive reforms that resulted in rapid economic growth followed by extremely high inflation rates in 1988 and 1989. The high inflation rates gave the households strong motives to switch from financial savings to purchase of consumer durables, which also appear to be consistent with the structure of the observed data. By providing empirical evidence on the relative importance of savings by lower, middle and upper income groups for single-child families and for all households, this study also demonstrates that the savings decisions depend heavily on the level of household income. Single-child families are focused, not only because of its growing dominance in the current Chinese society, but also to control for the effect of demographic disparities."

      "Die verschiedenen Rollen der Information führten in der Entwicklung des IT-Managements bzw. des Informationsmanagements über die letzten Jahrzehnte immer wieder zu markanten Titulierungen, z. B. der Information als Produktions- oder als Wettbewerbsfaktor. Ein Wechsel in der Titulierung der Information als … steht für eine Verschiebung der Problem- und Aufgabenstellung in der IT und damit auch der Perspektive, unter der die Information oder die IT in Theorie und Praxis betrachtet wird. Gleichwohl verlieren ältere Perspektiven ihre praktische Bedeutung nicht. In der Regel gibt es keine Rolle, die zu einem Zeitpunkt allein von Bedeutung wäre. Gewöhnlich wird es also um das Nebeneinander von Rollen - ggf. bei Dominanz einer Rolle - gehen. Die Kenntnis der verschiedenen Rollen der Information ist hilfreich, um für einen aufgabenadäquaten und produktiven Umgang mit Information sensibilisiert zu sein. Nur dann, wenn die Rollen von Information und IT in einem Unternehmen klar sind und allgemein verstanden werden, kann eine effektive und effiziente Informationsnutzung von den Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern erwartet werden. Das Arbeitspapier bietet hierzu eine Hilfestellung, indem es die in Literatur und Fachdiskussion thematisierten Sichtweisen zusammenstellt und Bezüge diskutiert: Information als Wettbewerbs-, Produktions-, Kostenoder Risikofaktor sowie Information als Produkt oder als Ware."

      "This study explores the on-going development of a global digital economy through a case-study analysis of its impact on and prospects in South Africa. It argues that four factors are key to understanding the impact of the digital economy on a developing country: (i) the level of technology, including its information and communications infrastructure and system of production and distribution; (ii) the policy and regulatory framework and initiatives; (iii) the human capacity and income distribution; and (iv) the strategic approach of the state in response to dramatic global and domestic processes. The paper explores these four factors in the Republic of South Africa, with a focus on the period 1995-2000. Data for the study are drawn from survey research, published reports from national and international bodies, scholarly journals, structured interviews, and participant observation. Key findings of the study are as follows: an insufficient information and communications infrastructure remains a barrier to growth of the information economy in South Africa, especially in peri-urban and rural areas; awareness of the importance of the information economy is growing, but current human resources and development strategies are insufficient to meet human capital requirements; significant efforts have been made in order to re-orient the South African policy environment into one supportive of growth in a global digital economy; and South Africa’s role as a leading African and developing world economy places additional burdens on its need to engage in regional, and global policy formulation activities in support of the emergence of a new regime for global e-commerce that is supportive of the strategic goals of the developing world."

      "In this paper, we focus on the role of different types of crises (technological crises, financial market crises, natural disasters) and their effects on the demand for cash in an international context. It becomes evident that over the past 30 years cash demand always increased in times of crises, independent of the nature of the crisis itself.However, the type of crises determines whether small or large banknote denominations are affected more. In case of payment uncertainties, we find a crisis-related increased demand for small denominations, probably reflecting an increased demand for transaction balances. In times of uncertainties regarding the financial and/or general economic development (also possibly driven by natural disasters), large banknote denominations were comparatively more in demand indicating that the crises-related need for non-transaction balances was the dominant driver."

      "In this empirical paper, I use the 1996 wave of the ECHP dataset to investigate the relationship between measures of wage compression and training incidence in 11 European countries. I find that, after controlling for individual factors and country specific institutional differences, there is evidence of a positive and significant relationship between wage compression and training. This positive relationship is confirmed when I consider only general training. While the former finding is consistent with both competitive and non - competitive approaches to training, the latter result is only consistent with the non - competitive approach."

      "During the Great Recession, immigrants reacted to the drop in labour demand in Spain through internal migration or leaving the country. Consequently, provinces lost 13.5% of their immigrants or - 3% of the total labour supply, on average. Using municipal registers and longitudinal administrative data, I find that immigrant outflows slowed the decline in employment and wage of natives. I use a modified shift-share instrument based on past settlements to claim causality. Employment effects were driven by increased entries to employment, while wage effects were limited to natives that were already employed. These effects also persisted in the medium-term."

      "CGE models are widely used for policy evaluation and impact analysis especially with respect to trade reforms, tax reforms, energy sector reform and development policy analysis. However, the results of such models are often argued to be sensitive to the choice of exogenous parameters such as trade elasticities. Several authors show that the choice of the so-called Armington elasticities in the import demand function has a strong influence on the simulation results. Most existing estimates of Armington elasticities are only for the US. The few studies for other countries find substantially differing results. Nevertheless, many CGE modelers simply adopt the elasticities from the literature. This paper aims at providing estimated elasticities based on recent data for a larger group of European countries. Using cointegration and panel fixed effects analyses we estimate the first order condition resulting from cost minimization or utility maximization subject to the CES subutility or cost function in imports and domestic goods. The results show a rather large variation across sectors and countries and the magnitude is only partly comparable to the US elasticities. Moreover, in a small CGE application we are able to show that changing the elasticity set has a quantitative and even qualitative impact on CGE model results, which confirms the concern that one might end up with biased results due to a misspecification of the elasticities.",

Armingtonelastizitäten notwendig ist, übernehmen dennoch viele Modelle die Elastizitätensätze anderer Länder (meist australische oder US-amerikanische Elastizitätensätze), ohne ihre Modellergebnisse auf Robustheit gegenüber der Parameterwahl zu schätzen. Der vorliegende Beitrag versucht diesen Kritikpunkt anzugehen, indem Elastizitäten für ein Panel von europäischen Staaten geschätzt werden. Die Autorinnen finden eine relativ breite Streuung der Ergebnisse und insb. erhebliche Unterschiede über die Länder und nur in manchen Fällen Ergebnisse der Größenordnung der am weitesten verbreiteten Elastizitäten. In einer beispielhaften Modellanwendung werden die geschätzten Elastizitäten alternativ in einem etablierten Modell verwandt, statt der dort enthaltenen. Im Ergebnis zeigt sich, dass es nicht nur einen quantitativen, sondern sogar z.T. einen qualitativen Einfluss auf die Simulation hat, welcher Elastizitätensatz Verwendung findet. Somit kann geschlussfolgert werden, dass die Gefahr einer Missspezifikation bei nicht ausreichend fundierten Parametern groß ist."

      "This paper begins with a short review and discussion of the literature on policy complementarities and its implications in terms of (sustainable) growth strategies and the possible emergence of a new policymaking paradigm. Thereafter, it analyses the effect on growth of complementarities in structural policies in the specific context of a post-crisis recovery. The application of this framework to the Asian crisis can be regarded as a natural experiment. As the result of computing a complementarity indicator and a reform level indicator adjusted for complementarity for the most affected economies-Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand-this study finds that these indicators, for which a comprehensive group of policy areas was considered, are clearly related to higher immediate resilience and to faster recoveries. The results suggest that while augmenting the levels of the so-called orthodox policies is necessary, it is not sufficient to generate high sustainable growth trajectories, as they must be complemented with other policies and evolve in a parallel way."

      "In this paper, we study the awareness of European and U.S. insurance companies of climate-related risks and opportunities using a respective indicator from the Refinitiv Eikon database that uses reporting data. Based on this, we examine the determinants and value of the awareness of business risks and opportunities resulting from climate change, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been done so far, despite its increasing and specific relevance for the insurance industry. We use a logistic regression analysis as well as a linear fixed effects model for a 10-year period from 2009 to 2018. Our results show that larger European insurers are significantly more likely to exhibit such awareness. When controlling for subsectors, property & casualty insurers tend to be aware of the risks and opportunities resulting from climate change. Moreover, when using the linear fixed effects model, we find a statistically significant positive value effect on Tobin's Q."

      "This paper uses a McFadden choice model to measure the importance of destination, household and seasonal characteristics on the tourism destination choices of Irish households. The analysis is based on quarterly survey data of Irish households' travel destinations between 2000 and 2006. In total, some 55 000 holiday trips were observed. Destination characteristics such as temperature, GDP and coastline are found to positively influence choice probabilities, while population density and distance have a negative effect on choice. Household specific characteristics such as the numbers of people over 60 and children in a household are found to be important. We also identify differences in preferences across seasons and a change over time of the effect of destination country GDP on Irish holiday destination choices."

      "Relatively little is known about the roles that taxes and transfers play in redistributing resources and providing insurance across individuals and across the lifecycle. We embed these alternative roles in a lifecycle model, allowing us to demonstrate what the tax and transfer system achieves from a lifecycle perspective and why it is valuable. We undertake a five-way de-composition of net transfers into a giveaway term and terms corresponding to between- and within-individual redistribution and between- and within-individual insurance. These components are distinguished from perspective of the start of working life, and we consider both the magnitude of net transfers involved and the associated welfare values. Our focus is on females and we also highlight how behavioural responses affect the results. Analysis is conducted for the 2015 UK tax and transfer system relative to a at-rate baseline, showing what value is provided by the complex tax and welfare entitlement rules in a modern economy. We also consider what is achieved by two important UK bene t reforms the working families' tax credit (WFTC) reform of 1999 and the universal credit (UC) reform that began in 2013. Our main conclusions are that insurance against wage and family composition shocks is substantial and highly valued by individuals. Within-individual redistribution (i.e. across periods of life) is generally of little value even in the presence of strict borrowing constraints. Behavioural responses tend to increase the size of reform giveaways at the expense of the other components."

      "We estimate the impact of exposure to conflict on health outcomes using geographic information on households' distance from conflict sites – a more accurate measure of shock exposure – and compare the impact on children exposed in utero versus after birth. The identification strategy relies on exogenous variation in the conflict's geographic extent and timing. Conflict-exposed children have lower height-for-age, and impacts using GPS information are 2-3 times larger than if exposure is measured at the imprecise regional level. Results are robust to addressing endogenous migration. Health service disruptions and maternal stressors are potential explanations for the negative health effects on children."

      "Traditionally, the analysis of regional economic convergence is based on the notions of β-convergence and σ-convergence. However, both of these approaches have several drawbacks and limitations. To overcome these difficulties, we apply a more recent non-parametric approach in the convergence literature, which differs from the other non parametric kernel estimator approaches. This is the stochastic dominance approach, which is traditionally implemented in investment decision making. Stochastic dominance analysis has many advantages, relative to the traditional methods for convergence analysis, as it is based on minimal assumptions and it is not bound to a certain distribution. Additionally, it produces more evidence about the shape and the evolution of the regional per capita income distribution, rather than a simple measure of dispersion as the σ-convergence approach does. Furthermore, it supports statistical significance tests for the identified tendency towards convergence. Thus, stochastic dominance analysis offers the possibility to examine the whole distribution of per capita income and also to test for polarization. In this study, we investigate the existence and the nature of per capita income convergence between the Greek NUTS-III regions. Specifically, our data covers the 1995-2006 period and the 51 Greek perfectures. Moreover, convergence is studied using the traditional parametric approaches, and the results are compared to those of the stochastic dominance approach."

      "Homeownership rates differ widely across European countries. We document that part of this variation is driven by differences in the fraction of adults co-residing with their parents. Comparing Germany and Italy, we show that in contrast to homeownership rates per household, homeownership rates per individual are very similar during the first part of the life cycle. To understand these patterns, we build an overlapping-generations model where individuals face uninsurable income risk and make consumption-saving and housing tenure decisions. We embed an explicit intergenerational link between children and parents to capture the three-way trade-off between owning, renting, and co-residing. Calibrating the model to Germany we explore the role of income profiles, housing policies, and the taste for independence and show that a combination of these factors goes a long way in explaining the differential life-cycle patterns of living arrangements between the two countries."

      "We exploit exogenous variation from a pension reform in Denmark to estimate the effect of tax subsidies on total private saving. We present new evidence on individuals in the middle of the income distribution and show that a reduction in tax subsidies for retirement saving reduces total private saving. The reform changed the tax incentives for saving in the pension scheme that holds the highest tax advantage for middle-income workers in Denmark. We find that for each unit of reduced saving in this pension scheme, only 63 percent is substituted to other types of saving."

      "The concept of scapegoating is frequently used to explain how opportunistic elites attempt to deflect blame onto vulnerable ethnic minorities, particularly during times of social turmoil. However, the notion of scapegoating is undertheorized in the conflict literature and the question of why elite scapegoating only sometimes leads to violence is seldom addressed. This paper seeks to redress the balance by interrogating spatial variations in violence against the economically dominant ethnic Chinese in Indonesia within the city of Jakarta in the late 1990s. By demonstrating different trajectories of violence within a 'broadly violent city', this study illustrates the importance of disaggregating the unit of analysis in conflict studies. The study argues that elite-orchestrated campaigns of scapegoating succeed only if specific attributes invoked in such campaigns resonate at the local level; violence is more likely when prevailing local conditions amplify the pointed nature of the elite rhetoric. This in turn magnifies the threat perceived by the local community, provides focal points for mobilization against the disliked 'other' and in turn makes certain Chinese communities more 'scapegoatable'. Typically, scapegoating of the Chinese entails invoking entrenched stereotypes of the group as non-Moslem, non-native, economically dominant outsiders. Local mechanisms which activate these stereotypes include higher visibility of non-Moslem sites of worship, heightened ethnic competition, and ostensible symbols of wealth associated with the Chinese."

      "The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerabilities women encounter in labor markets worldwide. We investigate the potential of social protection measures in mitigating declines in women's labor market participation. Specifically, we look at the Indian context, where lockdowns spurred a reverse migration of male workers from urban to rural areas, exerting pressure on rural labor markets. Despite a 6% rise in reliance on India's largest demand driven employment guarantee scheme, our analysis reveals a 0.4% decrease in women's participation during the pandemic, equivalent to a loss of 11,500 person-days of work. However, a gender quota provision helped sustain women's employment status. In districts where the reservation quotas had not been exhausted pre pandemic, women's share in public works increased by 2.7%. Our findings underscore the need for mandated provisions and targeted programs for women to counteract labor market withdrawals and bolster overall labor market participation in times of crisis."

      "The bulk of recent literature on foreign exchange interventions has overlooked the potential interdependencies that may exist between these operations and the conduct of monetary policy. This is the case even under inflation targeting and especially in emerging-market economies, because central banks often explicitly reserve the right to intervene to calm disorderly markets and to accumulate foreign reserves, and when the exchange rate is perceived as being out of step with fundamentals. This paper uses a friction model to estimate intervention reaction functions and the associated marginal effects for Brazil and the Czech Republic since the adoption of inflation targeting in these countries in 1999 and 1998, respectively."

The unemployment level rose across the EU 27 after 2008 and peaked only in 2013, i.e. decline started only from 2014 onwards. The middle and high qualified youth (20-29 years old) had the lowest percentage point increase in unemployment between 2007 and 2013, which rose from 7 percent to 11 percent, and managed to reach their pre-crisis levels by 2017. While the low qualified youth were disproportionately hit by the crisis, witnessing an increase in unemployment levels from 13 to 22 percent between 2007 and 2013. Moreover, they have also not managed to return to their pre-crisis unemployment level in 2019.However, it should be noted that while youth unemploymentincreased more in absolute terms relative increase as well as relative difference to overall employment did not change much. This indicates a level effect rather than a mere age effect. [...]",

      "This paper investigates whether firms innovate persistently or discontinuously over time using an innovation panel data set on German manufacturing and service firms for the period 1994?2002. We find that innovation behaviour is permanent at the firm?level to a very large extent. Using a dynamic random effects discrete choice model and a new estimator recently proposed by Wooldrigde (2005), we further shed some light on the driving forces for this phenomenon. The econometric results confirm the hypothesis of true state dependence for manufacturing as well as for service sector firms. In addition to past innovation experience, the results further highlight the important role of knowledge provided by skilled employees and unobserved individual heterogeneity in explaining the persistence of innovation."

      "During the 2000–2016 period, Canada’s economy and labor market performed well. An important element in this success was the strong resource boom that lasted from the late 1990s to 2014. Since that time the economy and labor market have been undergoing a painful adjustment, a process that is now essentially complete. A good rule of thumb when examining many aspects of the labor market, such as the extent of unionization and the level of the minimum wage relative to the median wage, is that Canada is situated roughly halfway between the US and Europe."

      "In this paper we propose an alternative explanation for the nature, sources and consequences of inflation rate differentials in a monetary union, such as EMU. To achieve this, we build on the new neoclassical synthesis (NNS) framework, recently advanced by Goodfriend (2002) and Goodfriend and King (2000). Based on the NNS setup, we discuss the inflationary consequences of the catching-up process in a heterogeneous monetary union. In particular, we explore the interaction between catching-up and inflation differentials and offer an interpretation of the nature of this interaction. Our discussion is in stark contrast to the conventional Balassa-Samuelson (BS) interpretation. In particular, we demonstrate that divergent inflation rates between Member States do not necessarily have to be an equilibrium phenomenon, even if the original shock comes from the supply-side of the economy. Second, we show how a centralized monetary policy may produce such divergence of individual country's inflation rates when countries differ in size and in trend productivity growth. Against this background, we additionally show how the catching may potentially lead to unsustainable credit booms in a catching-up member country. Finally, we indicate some important deficiencies of the BS model as a guide to short- and medium-run policy making analysis."

      "The internet virtually revolutionized the possibilities of employee recruiting. First of all, this contribution undertakes a description of the market. Then, advantages and possible problems of the recruitment via internet are discussed. The empirical study analyses the issues, which persons search for and find a new job via internet and which consequences arise for these persons. The results include that rather well educated persons find jobs with long working hours via internet. Controlling for several individual and job-based characteristics no differences with regard to wages and job satisfaction are found compared to other ways of recruiting."

      "Previous research indicates that exporting firms are willing to pay a premium to poach workers from other exporting firms if experience working for an internationally engaged firm reduces trade costs. Since international experience is less valuable to non-exporters, we would expect to see differences in recruitments between firms that are internationally engaged and those that serve only their domestic market. Moreover, as emphasized in Davidson et al. (2020), increased openness might lead to higher job-to-job mobility if increased globalization increases both the share of exporters as well as the number of workers with skills that make them attractive for other exporters. Using linked Swedish employer-employee data for the period 1997-2013, we do find systematic differences between the way exporters and non-exporters recruit workers: exporters have a relatively high share of recruitments from other exporters as hypothesized. We also find that increased openness correlates positively (negatively) with upward (downward) mobility. The effects are strongest for professionals and managers. Hence, our findings provide empirical support for Davidson et al. (2020)."

      "Information and Communications Technology (ICT) has become a necessity in social and economic development and is a leading sector to enable and drive growth in other sectors in Cambodia such as education, agriculture, and health. Recently, the mobile telecom service market in Cambodia has demonstrated rapid growth, which is jumping off the fixed-line, with a penetration rate of 75.27% of the total population by the end of 2010. Despite this rapid growth rate, the mobile telecom service market in Cambodia faces a number of key challenges. There seems to be excessive competition in the mobile telecom service market due to the number of operators (eight active operators). In the short term, this market favors demand side rather than supply side by lowering prices. Consumers' welfare increases with the lower prices resulting from heavy competition. Also the dominant market players gain relatively higher profits while those of the less-dominant players have been squeezed by increasing market polarization. Furthermore, there is a lack of sector policy framework, Telecommunication Law, which means government Ad hoc regulations are implemented in the market to resolve the issues. These factors will contribute to market failure and lower market efficiency in the long run. This study examines the competitive environment of the mobile phone market in Cambodia to identify what the challenges are and how to overcome them through the involvement stakeholders in the mobile phone market in Cambodia. In addition, we criticize the current static efficiency-based market performance. We analyze various data including relevant government documents, operators' data, and materials from relevant websites. Furthermore, a survey was conducted with 150 people to examine the consumers' assessment on the experiences of mobile telecom services usage. The expected results will verify that the current static efficiency-based policy framework results in a stagnant market and is lacking sustainable driving force, which needs to be resolved in the dynamic perspective. Finally, we propose future policy framework for the dynamic efficiency enhancement in the market."

      "Household survey data provide a rich information set on income, household context and demographic variables, but tend to under report incomes at the very top of the distribution. Administrative data like tax records offer more precise information on top incomes, but at the expense of household context details and incomes of non-filers at the bottom of the distribution. We combine the benefits of the two data sources and develop an integrated approach for top-corrected Gini coefficients where we impute top incomes in survey data using information on top income distribution from tax data. We apply our approach to European EU-SILC survey data which in some countries include administrative data. We find higher inequality in those European countries that exclusively rely (Germany, UK) or have relied (Spain) on interviews for the provision of EU-SILC survey data as compared to countries that use administrative data."

      "Resource and supplier relationship management continues to play a critical role in the efficiency of the supply chain and its competitive positioning. The current study sought to establish how the paint manufacturing industry's performance is influenced by resource allocation (finance, human, physical, and information resources) and supplier relationship management (systematic collaboration, activities programs, and review meetings) and their ultimate contribution to organizational performance. The objectives of this study were to establish the effect of resource allocation on supplier relationship management and determine how supplier relationship management influences the performance of the paint manufacturing industry. Using a simple random sampling method, data were collected from 116 employees involved in the procurement process from 30 paint manufacturing firms in Harare. A questionnaire with Likert-type questions was distributed electronically to collect the data. This study established that there is a high inadequacy of resources to support the supplier relationship management system. A greater percentage of organizations (77.5%) employ procurement staff with the necessary qualifications and experience to manage the buyer-supplier relationship. The study further revealed that some organizations (98%) within the paint manufacturing industry do not have websites for supplier interaction due to limited financial resources, thereby impacting their supplier information resources. This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by providing new insights into the need for sufficient resource-supplier relationship management, as it greatly contributes to the performance of the paint manufacturing sector."

      "In 2008, the BMBF-funded, interdisciplinary research project 'Economic and Ecological Restructuring of Land- and Water Use in the Region Khorezm (Uzbekistan) initiated a participatory approach to innovation development and diffusion with local stakeholders. Since mid 2008, four selected agricultural project innovations are jointly tested by teams of researchers, local farmers and water managers under real-life settings. While the activities during the first year focussed on induced learning by scientists, the second year's emphasis was on the identification of and integration with the appropriate stakeholders and the conducting of jointly designed and implemented experiments to test, validate, and if needed, adapt the selected innovation packages. This paper documents these and focuses on the sub-processes within each team, how the team members understood and approached stakeholder collaboration, how they operationalised their scientific thinking into practical steps, and what impacts these processes had in terms of improving or validating the innovations."

      "This paper investigates the extreme dependence between the Asia-Pacific stock markets and the international crude oil market by applying the quantile regression theory and using daily data from January 4th, 2000 to July 4th, 2016. The authors obtain a more detailed result on the degree and structure of the dependence, and furthermore, the results present an asymmetric and heterogeneous dependence. Moreover, the dependence increases dramatically after a structural break point, meaning a crisis. Additionally, the authors observe a more significant dependence at the lower tails than the upper tails. They demonstrate the positive relationship at low quantiles, which is evidence of positive dependence in recessions or bearish markets."

Even if it does not shield establishments from redundancies (Calavrezo, Duhautois and Walkowiak, 2009a), STC can preserve an establishment's survival. This paper studies the relationship between STC and establishment exit over the period 2000-2005. We merge six data sets and we test the relationship between STC and establishment exit with propensity score matching techniques. Our results show that, on average, the year after establishments implement STC, they exit the market more intensely than establishments that do not use the program."

      "Diese Studie analysiert die Spielräume und Handlungsoptionen der Fiskalpolitik in Österreich für die kommenden Jahre im europäischen Kontext. Unter der bestehenden Zins-Wachstumskonstellation bestehen in Österreich ebenso wie in mehreren anderen Eurozonenländern erhebliche Spielräume für eine expansivere Ausrichtung der Fiskalpolitik, ohne dass die Stabilität der öffentlichen Finanzen gefährdet wäre. Die bestehenden europäischen und nationalen Fiskalregeln erlauben dem österreichischen Gesamtstaat für das Jahr 2020 einen fiskalischen Stimulus von bis zu 3 Milliarden Euro (0,7% des BIP), wobei aktuell für das Jahr 2021 von einem mindestens ebenso hohen Spielraum auszugehen ist. Selbst bei einer vollständigen Ausschöpfung dieses Potenzials für eine expansivere fiskalpolitische Ausrichtung würde die Staatsschuldenquote weiter in Richtung des in den EU-Fiskalregeln festgelegten Grenzwerts von 60% des BIP absinken. Fiskalische Stabilisierungspolitik sollte im Wirtschaftsabschwung zeitgerecht umgesetzt, auf besonders betroffene Menschen zielgerichtet und temporär sein, um möglichst effektiv Beschäftigung und Wirtschaftswachstum zu fördern. Expansive fiskalpolitische Maßnahmen, die diesen Kriterien entsprechen, sind beispielsweise zusätzliche AMS-Mittel für Vermittlung und Qualifizierung, Kurzarbeitsbeihilfe, Sonderabschreibungen für Investitionen, und öffentliche Investitionen. Für öffentliche Investitionen lässt sich aktuell im Bereich der Klimapolitik jedoch unabhängig von der konjunkturellen Lage ein öffentlicher Investitionsbedarf feststellen. Insoweit ein langfristig angelegtes Investitionsprogramm nicht im Rahmen der kurzfristig vorhandenen fiskalischen Spielräume finanzierbar ist, könnten die Fiskalregeln adaptiert werden, um die Spielräume für investive Ausgaben des Staates (insbesondere in den Klimaschutz) zielgerecht auszuweiten. Dabei kommt etwa die Einführung einer goldenen Regel für öffentliche Investitionen in Frage, die öffentliche Nettoanlageinvestitionen aus den spielraumbeschränkenden Defizitmaßen herausrechnet.",
      "This study analyses the fiscal policy space in Austria for the coming years in a European context. Under the existing interest-growth constellation, there is considerable scope for a more expansionary fiscal policy stance in Austria as well as in several other euro area countries (including Germany and the Netherlands), and a well-dosed expansionary fiscal policy stance would not jeopardise the stability of public finances. The existing fiscal rules allow the Austrian state a fiscal stimulus of up to EUR 3 billion (0.7% of GDP) for the year 2020, with at least as much room for manoeuvre currently expected for 2021. Even if this potential for a more expansionary fiscal policy stance were to be fully exploited, the public debt-to-GDP-ratio would continue to fall towards the 60% of GDP limit set by the EU's fiscal rules. Fiscal stabilisation policies should be timely, targeted at particularly affected people and temporary in order to promote employment and economic growth as effectively as possible. Expansionary fiscal policy measures that meet these criteria would include, for example, additional AMS funds for placement and qualification, short-time work subsidies, special depreciation possibilities for companies' investment, and public investment. However, a need for additional public investment can currently be identified in the area of climate policy, irrespective of business cycle conditions. To the extent that a long-term investment programme cannot be financed within the existing fiscal framework, the fiscal rules could be adapted in order to expand the space for public investment (especially to tackle climate change). This could involve, for example, the introduction of a golden rule for public investment, which would remove public net fixed capital formation from the deficit indicators that restrict the room for manoeuvre."

      "Over the last century, global life expectancy has increased tremendously. A longer planning horizon may change individuals' incentives to work, save, and marry but it has proven challenging to disentangle such incentive effects from those of improved health. In this paper, we study how individuals diagnosed with HIV reacted to the introduction of HIV medicine in 1995, which dramatically increased their life expectancy. To isolate the incentive effect, we use Danish register data on HIV-infected individuals and compare how outcomes evolved for individuals who were diagnosed before and after the medicine was introduced, but whose health had not yet been affected by their HIV diagnosis. Our results show that increases in the life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals greatly reduced the negative effect of receiving a HIV diagnosis on labor supply and earnings but did not affect important financial decisions, despite a much longer investment horizon. An increased life expectancy also affected marital behavior, where those facing a longer life expectancy where less likely to marry or cohabit after receiving a HIV diagnosis. Our results highlight that life expectancy gains from medical innovations impact individuals' incentives to work and marry, even when their underlying health is unchanged."

      "Does providing information improve citizens' perception about government transparency? Does all information matter the same for shaping perceptions about the government? This paper addresses these questions in the context of an online randomized survey experiment conducted in Argentina. Results show that providing information to citizens matters for shaping perceptions about transparency, and the content of the information matters for affecting the evaluation people make about the government. Those who received a \"positive\" treatment (showing that the government was over-performing on its promises) increased their trust in the government more than those who received a \"negative\" treatment (showing that the government was under-performing). The evidence highlights that the channel between transparency and trust may be mediated by the performance of the government."

      "The title of this piece is a somewhat heavy-handed word play. The property market I'mwriting about is the market in intellectual property, which is broken in so many ways, evidencedby the existence of patent mountains and patent trolls, fighting over how many angles they canfit in the 360 degrees around the head of a pin, rather than actually innovating. (It is well knownin creative tech circles that pausing to talk to the IP lawyers would never have led to thediscovery of the internet protocol). The emergent property I'm referring to is the possibility thatsuch a complex system could fairly suddenly exhibit some new behaviour. In this article, Ispeculate that this new behaviour could just be that the idea of property ceases to exist. Thearticle is written somewhat derivatively after the 1960s science fiction style of writers such asCyril Kornbluth, JG Ballard, and John Brunner. Any resemblance to their very creative output isentirely good luck rather than actual skill."

      "Background: his paper presents a case study on 100Credit, an Internet credit service provider in China. 100Credit began as an IT company specializing in e-commerce recommendation before getting into the credit rating business. The company makes use of Big Data on multiple aspects of individuals' online activities to infer their potential credit risk. Methods: Based on 100Credit's business practices, this paper summarizes four aspects related to the value of Big Data in Internet credit services. Results: 1) value from large data volume that provides access to more borrowers; 2) value from prediction correctness in reducing lenders' operational cost; 3) value from the variety of services catering to different needs of lenders; and 4) value from information protection to sustain credit service businesses. Conclusion: The paper also discusses the opportunities and challenges of Big Data-based credit risk analysis, which needs to be improved in future research and practice."

      "Most strategies for causal inference based on quasi-experimental or observational data critically rely on the assumption of unconfoundedness. If this assumption is suspect, sensitivity analysis can be a viable tool to evaluate the impact of confounding on the analysis of interest. One of the earliest proposals for such a sensitivity analysis was suggested by Rosenbaum/ Rubin (1983). However, while it is straightforward to obtain estimates for the causal effect under specific assumptions regarding an unobserved confounder, conducting a full sensitivity analysis based on a range of parameter settings is unwieldy based on the simple forking tables which Rosenbaum and Rubin used. To tackle the multiple parameter problem of the Rosenbaum-Rubin approach, we present an interactive R Shiny application called TippingSens, which visualizes the impact of various parameter settings on the estimated causal effect. Borrowing from the literature on tipping point analysis, the flexible app facilitates manipulating all parameters simultaneously. We demonstrate the usefulness of our app by conducting a sensitivity analysis for a quasi-experiment measuring the effect of vocational training programs on unemployed men. The online supplement accompanying this paper provides a step-by-step introduction to the app using the original illustrative example from Rosenbaum/Rubin (1983).",
      "Kausalanalysen mit quasi-experimentellem Forschungsdesign bspw. Matching-Verfahren schätzen die Wirkung einer Intervention auf eine Ergebnisvariable. Unverzerrte Schätzungen ergeben sich dabei nur, wenn die Kausalanalyse alle Merkmale mit Einfluss auf die Ergebnisvariable und auf die Selektion in die Intervention berücksichtigt. Wenn nicht sicher ist, ob all diese Merkmale berücksichtigt wurden, helfen Sensitivitätsanalysen, den Einfluss eines nicht beobachteten Merkmals auf die geschätzte Wirkung der Intervention zu bestimmen. Einen der ersten Vorschläge für eine solche Sensitivitätsanalyse lieferten Rosenbaum und Rubin (1983). Danach legen vier Parameter fest, wie das unbeobachtete Merkmal mit der Interventionswahrscheinlichkeit und der Ergebnisvariable (in Interventions-und Kontrollgruppe) zusammenhängt und wie es in der Grundgesamtheit verteilt ist. Einfache tabellarische Darstellungen für den Einfluss des nicht beobachteten Merkmals auf die geschätzte Wirkung für verschiedene Sets dieser vier Parameter stoßen schnell an die Grenze zur Unübersichtlichkeit. Dieses Problem lösen wir mit der interaktiven Web-Anwendung TippingSens. Sie basiert auf Shiny R Studio. TippingSens visualisiert gleichzeitig alle vier Parameter eines unbeobachteten Merkmals und zeigt für unterschiedliche Kombinationen und Ausprägungen dieser Parameter in welchem Ausmaß die Ergebnisse der Kausalanalyse durch das nicht beobachtete Merkmal verändert würden. Wir demonstrieren die Anwendung von TippingSens mit den Ergebnissen aus einer Wirkungsanalyse beruflicher Weiterbildung von Arbeitslosen. Der Web-Anhang zu diesem Artikel enthält eine Anleitung für TippingSens anhand des ursprünglichen Beispiels von Rosenbaum und Rubin."

      "Using a specially designed survey instrument in combination with a representative sample of Vietnamese enterprises, we explore firm-level efficiency effects of corporate social responsibility. We find a positive relationship between adoption of corporate social responsibility initiatives and firm efficiency, and reveal that the impact is stronger for firms in non-competitive industries. Moreover, we show that local community focused corporate social responsibility initiatives drive the aggregate effect. This suggests that socially responsible actions by firms are likely to pay-off when stakeholder engagement has a localized focus. We provide evidence of reciprocity by showing that employees accept a lower share of additionally generated value added in exchange for working in a company that signals 'good' corporate values."

      "Wage indexation practices have changed. Evidence on the U.S. for instance suggests that wages were heavily indexed to past inflation during the Great Inflation but not during the Great Moderation. However, most DSGE models assume fixed indexation parameters in wage setting, which might not be structural in the sense of Lucas (1976). This paper presents a New-Keynesian model in which workers, by maximizing their welfare, set their wage indexation rule in response to aggregate shocks and monetary policy. We find that workers index their wages to past inflation when technology and permanent inflation-target shocks drive output fluctuations; when aggregate demand shocks do, workers index to trend-inflation. In addition, workers' choices do not coincide with the social planner's choice, which may explain the observed changes in wage indexation in the post-WWII U.S. data."

      "The frequency and severity of financial and currency crises in emerging market economies since the mid-1990s have increasingly eroded confidence in the well-functioning of international capital markets. Cross-border currency transactions recorded a spectacular growth, reaching US$ 1500 billion per day in the late 1990s or about two thirds of Germany's annual GDP. About 80 percent of these transactions involve round-trips of seven days or less. Globalization critics conclude that international financial transactions have little to do with real economic activity, such as foreign trade, and are predominantly speculative in nature. In order to tame speculation and protect emerging market economies from the vagaries of global financial markets, globalization critics demand radical changes in the international financial order. Policymakers, notably those in major industrial countries, are criticized for remaining committed to liberalized financial markets. However, a fundamental reconstruction of the financial architecture does not only lack political support. As argued below, some radical reform proposals are also flawed from an economic point of view. Yet policymakers are to be blamed for having delivered at best partly what they had promised after recent financial crises, namely to adjust the regulatory framework to increased global capital mobility. In important respects, the process of reforming the international financial architecture appears to be stalled, mainly because of conflicting interests of major political players."

      "We construct a news-based viral disease index and study the dynamic impact of epidemics on the world economy, using structural vector autoregressions. Epidemic shocks have persistently negative effects, both directly and indirectly, on affected countries and on world output. The shocks lead to a significant fall in global trade, employment, and consumer prices for three quarters, and the losses are permanent. In contrast, retail sales increase. Country studies suggest that the direct effects are four times larger than the indirect effects and that demand-side dominate supply-side contractions. Overall, the findings indicate that expansionary macroeconomic policy is an appropriate crisis response."

      "When firms approach distress, whether they engage in asset substitution (risk shifting) or rebuild equity (risk management) may depend on their access to capital markets. The property-casualty insurance industry has two features that make it ideal for testing this hypothesis: (1) the main losses for insurers are exogenous events like hurricanes that provide a strong instrument for financial distress; and (2) many insurers are organized as mutual companies, which cannot issue stock. Consistent with the importance of capital constraints, stock companies issue new equity following a negative shock, while mutual companies increase the riskiness of their investment portfolios."

      "This study proposes a methodology for estimating child support, which combines two approaches. The first corresponds to the marginal approach, which approximates the cost of the child maintenance by comparing an equivalent income from households with the same level of well-being. The second is the per capita - average approach that approximates this cost through the so-called exclusive spending. We use the 2015-2016 Family Budget Survey to estimate the maintenance, considering households in five capital cities and the metropolis area of La Paz, which are above the moderate poverty line in Bolivia. Results shows that, on average, monthly child support represents 67% and 97% of the national minimum wage when the child studies in a public and private school, respectively. In this regard, we evidence that these percentages are higher than the minimum of 20% established by the Family and Family Process Code."

      "This paper examines, both theoretically and empirically, the effect of social networks and belonging to minority groups (or race) on the probability of winning in reality television shows. We develop a theoretical model that studies viewer behavior by presenting a framework of competition between two contestants from two different groups. The results are examined empirically using unique contestant data from the highly popular reality show A Star Is Born, the Israeli counterpart of American Idol. Our main finding is that social networks and belonging to minority groups play key roles in the contestant's victory, but their effects are nonlinear: the social network effect is U-shaped, whereas that of belonging to a minority group follows an inverted U shape. Beyond the world of reality TV, this paper sheds light on the general behavior of social networks as well."

      "We investigate the financial interactions between countries in the Pacific Basin region (Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan), Japan and US. The originality of the paper is the use of STAR-GARCH models, instead of standard correlation-cointegration techniques. For each country in the Pacific Basin region, we find statistically adequate STAR-GARCH models for the series of stock market daily returns, using Nikkei225 and S&P500 as alternative threshold variables. We provide evidence for the leading role of Japan in the period 1988-1990 (pre-Japanese crisis years), whereas our results suggest that the Pacific Basin region countries are more closely linked with the US during the period 1995-1999 (post- Japanese crisis years)."

This study investigates the impact of intellectual capital, its components, and ownership structure on firm performance. This study employs a balanced panel data examination for the data of 409 non-financial firms from 11 sectors listed on Bursa, Malaysia for five years (2016-2020). The modified value-added intellectual coefficient model was applied to examine the effect of IC efficiency on firm performance. The empirical findings revealed that IC efficiency, human capital efficiency, structural capital efficiency, capital employed efficiency, and relational capital efficiency are positively and significantly related to firm performance. However, physical and structural capital is the most substantial element of intellectual capital efficiency in augmenting profitability. In addition, government and foreign ownership positively affect firm performance. The research will help managers, policymakers, and investors understand how IC investments increase performance and make prudent investment choices in government and foreign ownership firms."

      "COVID-19 has uprooted many aspects of parents' daily routines, from their jobs to their childcare arrangements. In this paper, we provide a novel description of how parents in England living in two-parent opposite-gender families are spending their time under lockdown. We find that mothers' paid work has taken a larger hit than that of fathers', on both the extensive and intensive margins. We find that mothers are spending substantially longer in childcare and housework than their partners and that they are spending a larger fraction of their paid work hours having to juggle work and childcare. Gender differences in the allocation of domestic work cannot be straightforwardly explained by gender differences in employment rates or earnings. Very large gender asymmetries emerge when one partner has stopped working for pay during the crisis: mothers who have stopped working for pay do far more domestic work than fathers in the equivalent situation do."

      "One of the main results of the literature on the effects of uncertainty on trade states that uncertainty should not matter in the presence of well developed forward markets. Empirical studies, however, do not support this result. We derive the demand for forward cover in a small open economy with terms of trade uncertainty. Adopting a standard and more realistic decision structure than the one usually used in this literature, we find that risk averse agents will not buy forwards at an unbiased price. Agents treat forward contracts as an asset rather than as an insurance. This is the reason why, when calibrating the model, only 17% of imports are covered by forwards."

      "The aim of this paper is to empirically investigate the relationship between exchange-rate regime and economic growth, building on underlying theoretical examination and shortcomings of empirical literature. Channels through which regime might influence growth could be distinguished at: i) level of uncertainty imposed by certain regime, which than affects trading and investment decisions; ii) regime as shock absorber; iii) its linkage to productivity growth, which usually interferes with financial development. Empirical research offers divergent result though and is criticized because of: measurement error in regimes’ classification; appropriateness of growth framework; endogeneity of exchange-rate regime and/or other regressors; Lucas critique; sample-selection bias and survivor bias. Applying dynamic system-GMM panel estimation on 169 countries over the period 1976-2006 and addressing all shortcoming of the empirical literature, this paper finds that the exchange-rate regime is not statistically significant in explaining growth. The conclusion is robust to dividing the sample on developing versus advanced countries and considering two sub-periods. In all specifications, the exchange-rate regime does not even approach conventional significance levels. Observation de-facto versus de-jure regime matters neither. No empirical grounds were established that coefficients in the regression suffer the Lucas critique. Hence, the main conclusion is that, as nominal variable, the exchange rate regime does not have explanatory power over growth."

      "It has been shown, for non-Communist developed and developing countries, that earlier development of agriculture, a dense population, and a state-level polity is associated with a higher income and more rapid economic growth in the late 20th Century. We investigate whether this was also the case for countries under Communism and for the same countries in transition to a market economy. Our findings are generally affirmative, with an interesting pattern for the Eurasian socialist core countries involving higher growth nearer their west European and east Asian poles. We also find that ethnic fractionalization, which is correlated with late pre-modern development, shows harmful effects in the transition era but not under Communism."

      "The study analyses the welfare performance of banks’ lending services in the Ghanaian banking industry with emphasis on the role of market power and efficiency. We made use of pooled OLS regression with fixed effect model. For robustness, we adopted Prais–Winsten (1954) regression and two-stage least squares (2SLS) instrumental variables procedures on an unbalanced panel data of 24 banks for years 2009 through 2017. The results reveal that during our study period, there was a welfare loss of about 0.433 percent of observed total loans. Encouragingly, cost efficiency in the banking system fits well within the world’s mean efficiency but has been decreasing over time. Further, there is evidence that prices have not moved toward a competitive level. Cost efficiency estimates are found to be negatively associated with loss of consumer surplus estimates. Market power is found to be positively related to a loss in consumer surplus. Additional analysis shows that the market power effect is dominant in both domestic and large banks. Overall, the results indicate that market power and bank efficiency are competing interests for policymakers in their consideration of policy reforms geared toward an efficient and well-functioning banking system. An additional implication of these results suggests that antitrust enforcement may be socially beneficial to provide an incentive for competitive pricing in the lending business segment of banking. Other implications are also discussed."

      "This paper studies the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the gendered dimensions of employment and mental health among urban informal-sector workers in India. First, we find that men's employment declined by 84 percentage points post-pandemic relative to pre-pandemic, while their monthly earnings fell by 89 per cent relative to the baseline mean. In contrast, women did not experience any significant impact on employment post pandemic, as reported by their husbands. Second, we document very high levels of pandemic-induced mental stress, with wives reporting greater stress than husbands. Third, this gendered pattern in pandemic-induced mental stress is partly explained by men's employment losses, which affected wives more than husbands. In contrast, staying employed during the pandemic is associated with worse mental health for women and their (unemployed) husbands. Fourth, pre-existing social networks are associated with higher mental stress for women relative to men, possibly due to the 'home-based' nature of women's networks."

      "Ensuring energy security is a major concern of policymakers and economic planners. This objective could be achieved by managing the energy supply and its demand. The latter has received less attention, especially in developing countries. Neglect of energy consumption and its accurate forecasting leads to potential outages and also unsustainable development. Nonlinear methods that are consistent with the nature of energy consumption have led to better results. Therefore, in the present study, both aspects of sustainable development in the determinants of energy demand and the nonlinear hybrid method have been used. We introduced a model based on sustainable development indicators to forecast energy consumption in Iran in which the relevant indicators are specified by the determination phase. To forecast energy consumption, we provided a new standard dataset for energy consumption in Iran (IREC) based on the data extracted from the World Bank and Ministry of Energy dataset in Iran. The highlight of this research is that it provided the most efficient features from the dataset using the genetic algorithm and five forecasting approaches based on machine learning methods. The algorithm was able to select 14 features as the most effective indicators in predicting energy consumption from all the 104 ones in the IREC with 500 repetitions. The empirical results indicated that the model can provide important indicators for energy consumption forecasting. The experiment result of the model using the GA-Based feature selection indicates that the hybrid model has had better results and GA-SVM and GA-MLP have the best result respectively."

      "Research on couple bargaining and housework allocation focuses almost exclusively on partners’ economic resources. In this study, we ask whether additional bargaining resources, namely physical appearance and social networks, may exert a distinct effect – that is, whether partners can mobilize multiple resources within their bargaining framework. A focus on multiple bargaining chips is made possible by the German Socio-Economic Panel Study. In line with previous research, we conclude that earnings potential is the most important bargaining chip. But we also find that physical attractiveness can make a significant difference, although its effects depend on age. We uncover no distinct effects for social networks."

      "The current article attempts to investigate the causal relationship between human capital and economic growth in postwar Greece. For this purpose, we use annual time series data from 1952 to 2017 retrieved from the Penn World Table (PWT) version 9.1 and we apply the Toda -Yamamoto (1995) approach. Our findings indicate a one-way causality that runs fromhuman capital to economic growth. This is consistent with proposals that the Greek government, despite budget cuts due to the recent fiscal financial crisis, should focus its efforts on the development of human capital in order to achieve sustainable economic growth."

      "Among the steps to improve a country's competitiveness, several commentators and international institutions include a general emphasis on deregulation and decentralization of industrial relations. In this paper, we contribute to this debate by studying whether and how firm-level unionism and collective agreements affect workplace training, a key ingredient to competitiveness. Theory provides inconclusive predictions on the various channels and processes through which firm-level industrial relations may affect workplace training. Quantitative and qualitative analyses, when used in isolation, have also proved insufficient for an adequate account of the various factors at play. This is where our paper mostly contributes. In the spirit of opening the \"black box\" of firm-level unionism and collective bargaining, we mix together quantitative and qualitative strategies. Our results suggest that workplace unionism, and especially decentralized collective agreements, favor workplace training in subtler and often more dynamic ways than commonly understood."

      "The main contribution of this article is to examine the productivity spillover effects from India's inward foreign direct investment (FDI), controlling for trade, in the framework of the cointegrated vector autoregression (CVAR). For this purpose, using the Solow residual approach the aggregate total factor productivity (TFP) in India is estimated to measure FDI-induced spillovers. The results show that the inflow of FDI to India indeed improves TFP growth through positive spillover effects. We also find that trade appears to have a detrimental effect on TFP growth in India."

      "The political resource curse is the idea that natural resources can lead to the deterioration of public policies through corruption and rent-seeking by those closest to political power. One prominent consequence is the emergence of conflict. This paper takes this theory to the data for the case of Mozambique, where a substantial discovery of natural gas recently took place. Focusing on the anticipation of a resource boom and the behavior of local political structures and communities, a large-scale field experiment was designed and implemented to follow the dissemination of information about the newly-discovered resources. Two types of treatments provided variation in the degree of dissemination: one with information targeting only local political leaders, the other with information and deliberation activities targeting communities at large. A wide variety of theory-driven outcomes is measured through surveys, behavioral activities, lab-in-the-field experiments, and georeferenced administrative data about local conflict. Information given only to leaders increases elite capture and rent-seeking, while information and deliberation targeted at citizens increases mobilization and accountability-related outcomes, and decreases violence. While the political resource curse is likely to be in play, the dissemination of information to communities at large has a countervailing effect."

      "Dass die Wandlungsfähigkeit der deutschen Industrie neben ihrer Flexibilität einer ihrer entscheidenden Wettbewerbsvorteile ist, ist spätestens seit der letzten Wirtschaftskrise und dem daran anschließenden Aufholprozess offensichtlich. Umso erstaunlicher ist es, dass die Erfassung dieser wichtigen Fähigkeit bisweilen noch größte Schwierigkeiten bereitet. Ihr systematisches Management erfordert neben der Kenntnis geeigneter technischer und organisatorischer Befähiger auch Messkonzepte, die eine praktisch handhabbare Operationalisierung als strategische Zielgröße unterstützen. Um dieser Frage nachzugehen, hat das Fraunhofer ISI die Wandlungsfähigkeitspotenziale sowie -befähiger erstmals systematisch am Beispiel der deutschen Hightech-Industrie erfasst und einem vergleichenden Benchmarking zugeführt. Die Ergebnisse können Unternehmen helfen, Stärken und Schwächen ihrer Wandlungsfähigkeit im Vergleich zu anderen Firmen zu analysieren und konkrete Ansatzpunkte zu ihrer Steigerung aufzudecken."

      "Stock estimates' of missing women suggest that the problem is concentrated in South and East Asia and among young children. In contrast, `flow estimates' suggest that gender bias in mortality is much larger, is as severe among adults as it is among children in India and China, and is larger in Sub-Saharan Africa than in India and China. We show that the different stock and flow measure results rely on the choice of the reference standard for mortality and an incomplete correction for different disease environments in the flow measure. Alternative reference standards reconcile the results of the two measures."

      "We study stock market reactions to the Brexit referendum on 23 June 2016 in order to assess investors’ expectations about the effects of leaving the European Union on the UK economy. Our results suggest that initial stock price movements were driven by fears of a cyclical downturn and by the sterling depreciation following the referendum. We also find tentative evidence that market reactions to two subsequent speeches by Theresa May (her Conservative Party conference and Lancaster House speeches) were more closely correlated with potential changes to tariffs and non-tariff barriers on UK-EU trade, indicating that investors may have updated their expectations in light of the possibility of a ‘hard Brexit’. We do not find a correlation between the share of EU migrants in different industries and stock market returns."

      "The youth have long represented an important constituency for electoral mobilization in Africa. Today, as the region faces a growing 'youth bulge' that is disproportionately burdened by un- and underemployment, capturing the votes of this demographic is becoming more important than ever before. Yet, despite their numerical importance and the historical relevance of generational identities within the region, very little is really known about the political participation of Africa's youth. In order to address this issue, we combine country-level variables for 19 of Africa's most democratic countries with individual-level public opinion data from Afrobarometer survey data. A series of binomial and multinomial logit models are estimated on three key outcome variables: voter turnout in last elections, closeness to political party; and participation in protests. In comparison with older citizens, we find that Africa's youth tend to vote less and express a lower level of partisanship, which is consistent with findings for the youth in other regions of the world. However, Africa's youth are not more likely to protest than older citizens. Collectively, these findings cast doubt that the youth are more likely to turn to the street when they are disgruntled but question the legitimacy of the electoral process as a meaningful conduit for conveying the preferences of Africa's youth."

      "We compare three common dispute resolution processes - negotiation, mediation, and arbitration - in the framework of Crawford and Sobel (1982). Under negotiation, the two parties engage in (possibly arbitrarily long) face-to-face cheap talk. Under mediation, the parties communicate with a neutral third party who makes a non-binding recommendation. Under arbitration, the two parties commit to conform to the third party recommendation. We characterize and compare the optimal mediation and arbitration procedures. Both mediators and arbitrators should optimally filter information, but mediators should also add noise to it. We find that unmediated negotiation performs as well as mediation if and only if the degree of conflict between the parties is low."

      "During 2022, about eight million Ukrainians were displaced from Ukraine due to the Russian invasion. Whether these individuals will return holds great significance for Ukraine's reconstruction and is pivotal in shaping integration strategies in host countries. We used Facebook ads to recruit a panel of Ukrainian refugees in Europe, starting in June 2022. Six waves carried out in 2022 and 2023 allow us to examine the causal impact of local conflict intensity on refugees' return intentions and integration. We find that less than 10% of Ukrainian refugees express a desire to permanently settle abroad. While the duration of time spent abroad leads to a higher proportion of refugees being employed, it does not diminish their intentions to return. Conflict intensity in one's home municipality decreases current return intentions, but it has only a small impact on plans to return once safety is restored."

      "An increasingly important part of contemporary merger control both in the US and the EU is unilateral effects analysis, particularly with regard to oligopolistic mergers. In practice, this requires econometric analyses of past market data and, above all, the construction of simulation models in order to quantify the price effects in each specific case. The review of the merger between the software firms Oracle and PeopleSoft in 2003/04 has been the most important instance of parallel application of these sophisticated economic tools by the EU and US authorities so far. This makes an in-depth study of the case going from the controversial issue of market definition to the specificities of the competitive assessment worthwhile. Therefore, we highlight certain similarities as well as (minor) differences between the EU and US proceedings. Interestingly, despite serious initial concerns the transaction was not blocked nor even required to be modified in the any of the two jurisdictions. We derive a number of interesting insights and, in particular, point out problems and lessons associated with the use of sophisticated economic tools in contemporary merger control. In addition to case-specific factors, the major insights encompass the continued relevance of market definition, the need to accompany predictive economic evidence with compatible reasoning and the benefits of including the economics of dynamic and evolutionary competition."

      "\"Business Process Standardization\" (BPS) is a practice intended to achieve consistency across underlying organizational processes, in support of service-delivery excellence and optimization of costs and benefits. Given the growing importance of BPS, there is need in both research and practice for clearer conceptual understanding of the notion. Following a systematic literature review approach, prior work on Business Process Standardization is synthesized and extended using tool-supported qualitative data analysis techniques, to derive an evidence-based, holistic conceptualization of BPS. We distil seven stages of BPS execution, propose a refined definition for BPS, and identify measures that gauge the several conceptual themes of BPS. The findings provide solid theoretical foundations, and practicable guidelines for future BPS researchers and practitioners."

      "This study posits that pandemics should be regarded as complex, open-ended phenomena that cannot be reduced to biology and epidemiology. The research assesses Ghana's effectiveness in governing the COVID-19 pandemic contrary to apocalyptic predictions. This paper critiques Ghana's responses to the COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of Foucault's biopolitics. The main result of this study showed that Ghana survived the pandemic because of effective policies, not providence. The study also found that the 'Ghana Beyond Aid' self-reliance agenda was given further impetus. The study concludes that the moderately intrusive biopolitical responses to COVID-19 did not deteriorate democratic norms in Ghana."

    "abstract": [
      "Arbeit in den Bereichen Softwareentwicklung und IT-Dienstleistungen galt lange Zeit als weitgehend resistent gegen die internationale Verlagerung. Doch spätestens seit Mitte der 1990er Jahre hat sich das Bild grundsätzlich gewandelt und auch in diesem Bereich der Wirtschaft begannen Unternehmen, ihre Produktion zunehmend zu internationalisieren. Der Internationalisierung wird in der Folge zugeschrieben, die Formen der Arbeitsorganisation und -kontrolle in dieser Branche grundsätzlich zu verändern, da die globale Verlagerung von Arbeitsprozessen deren zunehmende Standardisierung und Formalisierung nach sich ziehe und damit die Arbeit der IT-Beschäftigten in wesentlich direkterer Form der Kontrolle durch das Management unterwerfe. Entgegen dieser Prognose zeigt die vorliegende Arbeit unter Rückgriff auf zwei Fallstudien in transnational operierenden IT-Unternehmen, dass sich in der IT-Industrie im Zuge der Internationalisierung weniger einheitliche Tendenzen der Arbeitsorganisation und -kontrolle durchsetzen. Vielmehr setzen sich unterschiedliche Reorganisationsmodi von Arbeit durch, die mit unterschiedlichen Folgen für die Arbeitssituation der Beschäftigten einhergehen und von dem dynamischen Wechselspiel zwischen variierenden Internationalisierungswegen innerhalb der IT-Industrie und den institutionellen Gegebenheiten der Offshore-Standorte geprägt sind",
      "Recent developments have caused important changes in the IT industry: while being considered comparatively resistant to international relocation of jobs for a long time, the IT industry's landscape has changed a lot in the course of the 1990s, when IT companies started to make use of low-wage destinations and integrated them in globally distributed workflows. According to many authors the internationalisation of the IT industry does not only put jobs in high-wage countries into jeopardy, but also formalizes and standardizes the working processes, thus significantly limiting the employees' task discretion. Drawing upon case studies in the Indian subsidiaries of two transnationally operating IT companies, the presented study critically questions this prognosis. The results clearly show that the forms of work organisation and control in the IT industry do not develop homogeneously or uniformly in the course of internationalization. Instead, it is possible to identify specific modes of reorganization that are shaped by varying patterns of internationalization, on the one hand, and the institutional settings of the offshore destinations, on the other hand."

      "Despite numerous data challenges, economists have established that the multinational corporations' reported profits are not well aligned with their economic activity across countries. However, uncertainties remain about the extent and patterns of this misalignment. We fill in this gap for German-based multinational corporations and their foreign affiliates. We use the data collected by the Deutsche Bundesbank, which include confidential data on foreign direct investments and a combination of confidential and publicly available balance sheet data. We find that the world's tax havens attract a considerably higher share of German multinational corporations' profit than economic activity, while in Eastern European countries, most developing countries and some big European countries reported profits are much lower than economic activity would suggest. We also find that the most important tax haven is the Netherlands, followed by other EU tax havens of Cyprus, Ireland, Luxembourg and Malta."

      "We conduct a large-scale audit discrimination study to measure labor market discrimination across different minority groups in Australia - a country where one quarter of the population was born overseas. To denote ethnicity, we use distinctively Anglo-Saxon, Indigenous, Italian, Chinese, and Middle Eastern names, and our goal is a comparison across multiple ethnic groups rather than focusing on a single minority as in most other studies. In all cases, we applied for entry-level jobs and submitted a CV showing that the candidate had attended high school in Australia. We find economically and statistically significant differences in callback rates, suggesting that ethnic minority candidates would need to apply for more jobs in order to receive the same number of interviews. These differences vary systematically across groups, with Italians (a more established migrant group) suffering less discrimination than Chinese and Middle Easterners (who have typically arrived more recently). We also explore various explanations for our empirical findings."

For a convex penalty function the incentive-compatibility constraints may bind for the richest taxpayer and at a positive level of both evasion and avoidance. The audit function is non-increasing in reported income, and is higher for progressive tax functions than for regressive tax functions. Higher marginal tax rates increase the incentives for non-compliance, overturning the well-known Yitzhaki paradox."

      "Managerial competencies and performance appraisal practices are often ignored when considering the performance of Small-to-Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Yet, these competencies and practices are fundamental for the survival of the SMEs. SMEs are critical for economic growth and job creation in many economies. The current study sought to establish whether managerial competencies and performance appraisal practices correlate with SMEs' performance in South Africa. Firm performance was measured using two variables: innovation and return on investment (ROI). The study adopted a structural equation modelling analytical approach. Interpersonal competencies were found to be a significant factor of managerial competencies, but conceptual and political competencies were not. The study also found that managerial competencies, and not performance appraisal practices, significantly correlated with both innovation and ROI. The study recommends that performance appraisal practices be tailored to suit SMEs in the developing countries context."

      "m Jahr 1997 wurden die maximalen Anspruchsdauern auf Arbeitslosengeld für ältere Beschäftigte verkürzt. In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden die Auswirkungen dieser Reform auf Übergänge von Beschäftigung in Arbeitslosigkeit und Verweildauern in Arbeitslosigkeit der 54-56jährigen untersucht. Die Analyse beruht auf der IAB{Beschäftigtenstichprobe 1975-2001, welche tagesgenaue Informationen von über einer Million sozialversicherungspflichtigen Beschäftigten und Leistungsempäangern der Bundesagentur für Arbeit umfasst. Es kann festgestellt werden, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit, arbeitslos zu werden, bei der betrachteten Gruppe der 54-56jährigen nach der Reform abnimmt. Au?erdem wird eine Verkürzung der Dauer der Arbeitslosigkeit nach der Reform beobachtet. Die 54-56jÄahrigen unterscheiden sich nach der Reform nicht mehr von der Gruppe der 52-53jÄahrigen. Insbesondere größere Unternehmen und deren Beschäftigte nutzen die langen Anspruchsdauern auf Arbeitslosengeld zur Frühverrentung.",
      "In 1997, the German government enacted a reform of the unemployment insurance system which lead to a reduction of the maximum entitlement length for unemployment benefits. The paper analyses the effects of this reform on the risk of unemployment and on unemployment duration of the older unemployed aged 54-56. This group lost a smooth early retirement path via the unemployment benefits scheme. We show that the reform effectively reduced the amount of early retirement at the expense of the unemployment insurance. In particular larger companies and their employees use extended entitlement periods for unemployment benefits for early retirement purposes."

      "Using a general two-stage framework, this paper gives sufficient conditions for increasing competition to have negative or positive effects on R&D-investment, respectively. Both possibilities arise in plausible situations, even if one uses relatively narrow definitions of increasing competition. The paper also shows that competition is more likely to increase the investments of leaders than those of laggards. When R&D-spillovers are strong, competition is less likely to increase investments. The paper also identifies conditions under which low initial levels of competition make a positive effects of competition on investment more likely. Extending the basic framework, the paper shows that separation of ownership and control, endogenous entry and cumulative investments make positive effects of competition on investment more likely. Imperfect upstream competition weakens the effects of competition on investment."

      "In this paper, we discuss the relationship between responsibility and joint production. Responsibility mirrors our ability to act freely. We can act freely only if we can assume responsibility for our actions and their consequences; the limits of our responsibility are therefore also the limits of our liberty (part I). Thus, a problem of responsibility arises from our partial ignorance with respect to the consequences which our actions entail. Since this ignorance is at least partly irreducible, we are often not able to control our actions sufficiently. As will become clear, this does not only hold for the social world. Correspondingly, a problem of responsibility emerges in nature and the environment from the phenomenon of joint production (part II). The implications hereof with regard to different forms of responsibility will be discussed in part III of the paper. Part IV draws conclusions and offers a perspective for the future."

      "Using microdata from the 2000 U.S. Census, we analyze the responses of Mexican Americans to questions that independently elicit their ethnicity (or Hispanic origin) and their ancestry. We investigate whether different patterns of responses to these questions reflect varying degrees of ethnic attachment. For example, those identified as Mexican in both the Hispanic origin and the ancestry questions might have stronger ethnic ties than those identified as Mexican only in the ancestry question. How U.S.-born Mexicans report their ethnicity/ancestry is strongly associated with measures of human capital and labor market performance. In particular, educational attainment, English proficiency, and earnings are especially high for men and women who claim a Mexican ancestry but report their ethnicity as not Hispanic. Further, intermarriage and the Mexican identification of children are also strongly related to how U.S.-born Mexican adults report their ethnicity/ancestry, revealing a possible link between the intergenerational transmission of Mexican identification and economic status."

      "We here expand the static tax competition models in symmetric small regions, which were indicated by Zodrow and Mieszkowski (1986) and Wilson (1986), to a dynamic tax competition model in large regions, taking consideration of the regional asymmetry of productivity of public capital and the existence of capital accumulation. The aim of this paper is to verify how the taxation policy affects asymmetric equilibrium based on a simulation analysis using an overlapping generations model in two regions. It is assumed that the public capital as a public input is formed on the basis of the capital tax of local governments and the lump-sum tax of the central government. As demonstrated in related literature, the optimal capital tax rate should become zero when the lump-sum tax is imposed only on older generations, however, the optimal tax rate may become positive when it is imposed proportionally on younger and older generations. In the asymmetric equilibrium, several cooperative solutions can possibly exist which can achieve a higher welfare standard than the actualized cooperative solution either in Region1 or 2."

      "This work studies the impact of accounting for intrahousehold inequality in the distribution of resources for the measurement of poverty. For the estimation of intrahousehold distribution of resources the study relies on collective Engel curves. For the poverty analysis, we propose a fuzzy intrahousehold index which is less sensitive to small changes around the poverty line compared to standard FGT indices and produce more reliable results. This provides an interesting approach to address individual poverty in contexts where intrahousehold inequality is at work and there is a concentration of individuals near the poverty line. The proposed approach is applied to the analysis of individual poverty in Albania, finding an expected general increase in poverty rates. Besides, a previously unperceived issue – female poverty – emerges as a worryingly aspect to be accounted for in anti-poverty policies."

      "The study investigates how the agricultural sector can respond to a growing non-food biomass demand. Taking Germany as an example, a stylized case of biomass production under conditions of technological advance and constantly growing demand is modelled. It is argued that biomass producers might seek to adjust their farm size by simultaneously optimizing benefits from the production scale and transaction cost savings, where transaction costs are measured using Data Envelopment Analysis. The results extend the debate on transaction costs and structural change in agriculture by revealing a possible synergy and trade-off between transaction cost savings and benefits from (dis)economies of scale. They show that if larger farms cannot economize on transaction costs, then investments in land and labor, needed to adjust to higher biomass demand, partly compromise the returns to scale, which decelerates the farm size growth. A higher degree of asset specificity gives rise to transaction costs and reduces the rate at which the farm size decreases. Smaller producers may disproportionally benefit from their higher potential of transaction cost savings, if advanced technologies can offset the scale advantage of larger farms. The findings inform policymakers to consider this complex effect when comparing the opportunities of smaller and larger agricultural producers in the bioeconomy."

      "Die Ukraine und ihre internationalen Partner stehen vor einer gewaltigen Aufgabe: Nicht nur müssen sie den Wiederaufbau und den EU-Beitrittsprozess vorantreiben, sondern auch die Souveränität der Ukraine mithilfe militärischer und finanzieller Unterstützung im Kampf gegen den russischen Angriff verteidigen. Die Ungewissheit über den Ausgang des Krieges macht die Planung für den Wiederaufbau und den EU-Beitritt umso komplexer, unterstreicht aber auch, dass beide Vorhaben Hand in Hand gehen und sich gegenseitig verstärken sollten. Zu diesem Zweck hat die EU die Ukraine-Fazilität beschlossen. Damit stellt die EU der Ukraine bis 2027 verlässliche Finanzmittel für den Wiederaufbau und wichtige Reformen bereit, die für einen EU-Beitritt erforderlich sind. Der zentrale Fahrplan für die Umsetzung der Fazilität ist der sogenannte Ukraine-Plan der ukrainischen Regierung. Den Wiederaufbau und den EU-Beitritt gleichzeitig zu stemmen, könnte die Kapazitäten der ukrainischen Regierung und des Privatsektors überlasten, wodurch der Rückhalt in der Gesellschaft schwinden könnte. Um beide Prozesse bestmöglich zu verzahnen, sollten Entscheidungsträger*innen folgende Empfehlungen berücksichtigen: &#x25cf; Prioritäten für kurzfristige Hilfe mit langfristigen Ambitionen setzen. Wiederaufbaumaßnahmen zur Verbesserung der Sicherheitslage, zur Deckung der Grundbedürfnisse der Bevölkerung und zur Stabilisierung der ukrainischen Wirtschaft sollten Vorrang haben. Bei den EU-Beitrittsverhandlungen sollten grundlegende Beitrittsvoraussetzungen ('fundamentals') und die Verhandlungskapitel, die Wirtschaftswachstum und Wettbewerbsfähigkeit fördern, priorisiert werden. &#x25cf; Für einen inklusiven Ansatz in der Umsetzung des Ukraine-Plans sorgen. Deutschland und die Ukraine, die im Juni 2024 gemeinsam die Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC) ausrichten werden, sollten sicherstellen, dass auf dieser ein inklusiver Ansatz zur Umsetzung des Ukraine-Plans entwickelt wird, der über die diesjährige URC hinaus trägt. Eine Möglichkeit ist die Bildung themenspezifischer Bündnisse ukrainischer Akteure auf unterschiedlichen Verwaltungsebenen. &#x25cf; Internationale Geber für den Ukraine-Plan gewinnen und Wiederaufbaubemühungen als Hebel für einen beschleunigten EU-Beitritt nutzen. Deutschland könnte als EU- und G7-Mitglied als verbindendes Element zwischen den EU- und Nicht-EU-Akteuren fungieren, die sich für den Wiederaufbau der Ukraine einsetzen. Die EU-Mitgliedstaaten sollten ihre bilateralen Hilfen für die Ukraine auf den Ukraine-Plan abstimmen. &#x25cf; Maßgeschneiderte technische Hilfe bereitstellen und Kapazitätsaufbau ausweiten. Ukrainische und internationale Akteure sollten gemeinsam eine 'Asset Map' erarbeiten, die Kapazitäten und ungenutztes Potenzial (z. B. in Bezug auf Infrastruktur, öffentliche Finanzen, Industrie und Handel) in bestimmten Regionen und Gemeinden sowie im Privatsektor erfasst und dabei die Entwicklungsstrategien der verschiedenen Verwaltungsebenen berücksichtigt. Die ukrainische Diaspora in den EU-Ländern sollte aktiv an diesen Prozessen beteiligt werden, jedoch ohne unrealistische Erwartungen hinsichtlich ihrer zeitnahen und vollständigen Rückkehr. &#x25cf; Eine stufenweise EU-Integration der Ukraine vorbereiten. Die Bundesregierung sollte die europäische Debatte über mögliche Zwischenschritte auf dem Weg hin zur formellen EU-Mitgliedschaft weiter vorantreiben, wie etwa die schrittweise Integration der Ukraine in den EU-Binnenmarkt. &#x25cf; Für eine offene und transparente Kommunikation sorgen. Aufbauend auf einem offenen und transparenten Dialog muss eine wirksame Kommunikationsstrategie gegenüber der ukrainischen Bevölkerung entwickelt werden, um deren Unterstützung für einen EU-Beitritt zu erhalten. Auch innerhalb der EU bedarf es einer effektiven Kommunikation, um den politischen Spielraum von Vetospielern einzugrenzen."

      "This study aims to investigate the relationship between corporate governance (CG) compliance and corporate performance in Jordan. We develop a corporate governance index (CGI) and investigate its impact on firms' performance. The index consists of 32 unique internal governance attributes that were built based on Jordanian governance Code. This study used a quantitative research method using panel dataset analysis of 672-firm year observations. Fixed effects regression model was employed to analyse the governance-performance nexus. To infer correctly, we re-examine the main analysis using a well-developed dynamic generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator to overcome possible endogeneity concerns. Consistent with prior studies in developed and developing countries in the governance literature, our findings robustly disclose that compliance with CG guidelines is a determinant of corporate performance of listed firms in Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) during period 2009-2016. The results indicate that a better degree of compliance with the Jordanian code and guidelines is positively and significantly related with better performance of publicly listed firms. This study contributes theoretically and practically to growing but under-developed literature on governance compliance and corporate performance in developing countries. Therefore, this research has useful implications for developing countries, stock market authorities, policymakers, firms' directors, and academicians."

      "This study examines the trajectory of Orange's payment and banking services in Africa and the role of experiential knowledge, resources, and capabilities accumulated in Africa and Europe. The study is carried out through a chronological analysis of annual reports from 2008 to 2021, identifying events in financial innovations. Results show that, from the categorization of Orange's mobile financial and banking services within this study scope, it started from simple and secured mobile payments and expanded to advanced financial services, such as credits and savings to meet the growing demand of its markets. Also, there was a strong synergy between accumulated experiences in Africa and Europe, enabling rapid innovation development at minimal costs. Finally, while the Orange money innovation was disruptive in Africa, as it responded to the needs of the huge lowend market in Africa, which has been deprived of banking service, this was not the case with its transfer to Europe, which is an advanced market with numerous established players."

      "For sufficiently low abatement costs many countries might undertake significant emission reductions even without any international agreement on emission reductions. We consider a situation where a coalition of countries does not cooperate on emission reductions but cooperates on the development of new, climate friendly technologies that reduce the costs of abatement. The equilibrium size of such a coalition, as well as equilibrium emissions, depends on the distribution across countries of their willingness to pay for emission reductions. Increased willingness to pay for emissions reductions for any group of countries will reduce (or leave unchanged) the equilibrium coalition size. However, the effect of such an increase in aggregate willingness to pay on equilibrium emissions is ambiguous."

      "Berlin-Brandenburg airport (BER) has become well-known far beyond German borders due to substantial mis-planning and heavy delays in opening. Planned to open in March 2012 and to take over all air-transport services from Germany's capital city, with the other airports expected to close, construction work at BER is still ongoing in 2019. Four weeks before the expected opening of the airport, the opening was suddenly delayed by several months. This unexpected delay was an exogeneous shock for residents surrounding the largest existing airport, Berlin-Tegel, which is expected to close upon the opening of Berlin-Brandenburg. A series of additional delay announcements followed. We analyze the effect of airport noise and proximity to the airport on housing rental prices. Our identification strategy is based on the expectations regarding the closing of Berlin-Tegel airport. The results suggest that there is a negative effect of noise on housing rental prices while there are positive effects of proximity to Berlin-Tegel. These delays reduce rental prices by a small amount, when compared with the noise discounts in the literature for owner-occupied properties in studies of other cities. These findings likely occur because renters have a relatively short time horizon for their tenure in an apartment, on average, to benefit from the future noise reduction. For instance, a one-year delay for a renter who plans to stay in an apartment for only one or two years implies a very low benefit from the future noise reduction. We also find that the benefits from a delay announcement have a net negative effect on prices for rental properties that are in the noisier areas but further drive time from Tegel; and a net positive effect in the less noisy areas that are shorter drive time from Tegel. This likely re flects the disamenity from prolonged airport noise exposure, as well as the benefits from proximity due to expectation of continued ease of employment and travel access.",
      "Aufgrund der zahlreichen Bauverzögerungen und Baumängel hat der Flughafen Berlin-Brandenburg internationale Bekanntheit erlangt. Mehrere Eröffnungstermine konnten nicht gehalten werden und es kam im Verlauf immer wieder zu nicht erwarteten Verschiebungen der Eröffnungstermine. Diese Verschiebungen haben essenzielle Auswirkungen auf Bewohner, die um den aktuell genutzten Flughafen Berlin-Tegel wohnen, da dieser mit der Eröffnung von BER geschlossen werden soll. Die Bewohner um Tegel sind durch die Verzögerungen (unterwartet) weiterhin den Vor- und Nachteilen der Nähe zum Flughafen ausgesetzt. Sie profitieren einerseits durch Arbeitsplätze und bessere Erreichbarkeit, aber leiden andererseits unter der Lärmbelastung. Durch das einmalige Setup der unerwarteten und kurzfristigen Verlängerung des Betriebs in Tegel ist es uns möglich, die (negativen) Lärmeffekte und (positiven) Erreichbarkeitseffekte kausal zu analysieren. Messgröße ist dabei die Entwicklung von individuellen Mieten, die den Wert der Wohnumgebung bestmöglich abbilden. Dabei können wir beide Effekte (Lärm und Erreichbarkeit) individuell identifizieren. In einer umfassenden Schätzung zeigen wir, dass der negative Lärmeffekt dem positiven Erreichbarkeitseffekt überwiegt."

      "The principal contribution of this paper is to investigate the relationship between policy uncertainty, caused by recent developments in international markets, and firms' trade margins for the largest economy in Africa: South Africa. In particular, using a unique database on the population of traders, we investigate the exogenous result of the Brexit referendum and assess its impact on South African exporters' and importers' participation in the global market. Furthermore, we provide evidence of how this shock has had heterogeneous effects across different firm sizes, as well as across different product-specific tariffs, preferential trade agreements, and gravity model variables. We provide evidence of how the potential increase in trade barriers-through an increase in tariffs-has had a negative impact on the trade activity from uncertain markets, especially for small firms."

      "Tässä tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan yritysten tekemiä ulkoistuksia Suomen teollisuusyrityksissä. Tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan ulkoistusten yleisyyttä ja sitä, mitä toimintoja ulkoistukset ovat koskeneet. Tulosten mukaan teknologiateollisuuden (metalli-, konepaja- ja elektroniikkateollisuuden) yrityksistä keskimäärin 60 prosenttia on ulkoistanut toimintojaan. Muussa teollisuudessa vastaava osuus on 68 prosenttia. Yleisimmin ulkoistukset ovat suuntautuneet kotimaahan. Ulkomaille suuntautuneet ulkoistukset ovat yleisimpiä valmistustoiminnassa. Sen sijaan t&ktoimintaa on ulkoistettu ulkomaille vain harvassa tapauksessa. T&k-toimintaa ulkoistaneista teknologiateollisuuden yrityksistä puolet aikoo lisätä t&k-henkilöstöä Suomessa seuraavan kolmen vuoden aikana. Muissa teknologiateollisuuden yrityksissä vastaava osuus jää selvästi pienemmäksi."

      "In October 1999 the unemployment rate of people with severe disabilities in Germany was more than double that of the non-disabled population. To improve this situation, the People with Severe Disabilities Act was reformed to increase incentives for the severely disabled to enter the work force and for employers to hire such workers. In 2003 the Federal Government announced that through this reform it had successfully reduced the number of unemployed by 25% representing around 45,000 individuals. However, an evaluation of the impact of this policy reform on labour market outcomes for the severely disabled indicates that this was not achieved by getting these individuals into employment. Moreover, a recent deterioration in the number of unemployed suggests that the success in 2002 was at best temporary. Thus, there is no evidence that changes to financial incentives in the PSDA had a positive long-term impact on the employment of people with severe disabilities."

      "Introduction: Millennial nurses are beginning to accept leadership roles and will soon take over governance in the nursing profession and healthcare industry. This study aimed to describe the perspectives on leadership and their practice environment of millennial nurse administrators working in tertiary hospitals in Iloilo City, Philippines. Methods: Eight (8) millennial nurse administrators were purposively chosen. Through a qualitative descriptive inquiry by Sandelowski (2000), data were gathered using semi-structured interviews and analyzed employing qualitative content analysis. Results: Twelve (12) meaningful categories were derived directly from the interview transcripts. Millennial nurse administrators perceive leadership by way of (1) directing, (2) guiding, (3) empowering and (4) modeling to staff. They viewed their practice environment as (5) having a harmonious relationship while (6) maintaining professional relationship among the healthcare team members, (7) upholding standards and (8) ensuring client satisfaction as a measure of quality care. Millennial nurse administrators shared feelings of being (9) overwhelmed at the start yet (10) fulfilling in the end. Lastly, they had challenges in (11) dealing with older staff and in (12) assuming the full responsibility and accountability of their unit. Conclusions: Considering the complexities in the healthcare profession, millennial nurse administrators cope with the responsibilities brought by their position as major key players to ensure that unit operations abide with practice standards. Millennial nurse administrators must be provided with understanding, support, and mentoring, to enhance their leadership competencies as they progress into higher leadership positions."

      "There has been much discussion in the British general and specialised media over the last year on the adverse consequences of the economic and financial crisis on the British pension system. It should come as no surprise that the crisis has also adversely affected pension systems in most other countries too. This paper contributes to the current debate on pensions in the UK by discussing how pension systems outside the UK have been affected by the economic and financial crisis, and what governments have done to deal with the emerging issues. The paper starts by discussing what theory tells us about the likely impact of this type of crisis on different types of pension systems. While the impact should be more long term in the case of pay-as-you-go state pensions and defined-benefit occupational pensions, theory would suggest that the effects will be felt more immediately in the case of defined-contribution pension schemes or private savings. The paper then goes on to present a number of key developments and policy actions (if any) that have taken place in a select number of countries in the realm of pensions since the onset of the crisis in the second half of 2007. These countries have been chosen as they are representative for a large number of countries, from Chile with its very high dependency on private pensions to Germany, where unfunded social security pensions remain by far the most important source of retirement income. The paper finds that the real world experiences are in line with what could be expected theoretically and argues that regardless of whether a country relies more heavily on an unfunded pay-as-you-go state pension system or funded private pensions (whether defined benefit or defined contribution) the crisis has had an adverse effect everywhere. Existing systems will have to be refined or restructured more fundamentally, with the exact response likely to vary from country to country reflecting society’s interpretation of “inter-generational fairness”. Annex A provides information on the respective ageing trends in these countries, while Annex B discusses the respective arrangements set up to protect current and future pensioners’ entitlements if and when a pension scheme’s corporate sponsor becomes insolvent."

      "Exchange rates have raised the ire of economists for more than 20 years. The problem is that few, if any, exchange rate models are known to systematically beat a naive random walk in out of sample forecasts. Engel and West (2005) show that these failures can be explained by the standard-present value model (PVM) because it predicts random walk exchange rate dynamics if the discount factor approaches one and fundamentals have a unit root. This paper generalizes the Engel and West (EW) hypothesis to the larger class of open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. The EW hypothesis is shown to hold for a canonical open economy DSGE model. We show that all the predictions of the standard-PVM carry over to the DSGE-PVM. The DSGE-PVM also yields an unobserved components (UC) models that we estimate using Bayesian methods and a quarterly Canadian-U.S. sample. Bayesian model evaluation reveals that the data support a UC model that calibrates the discount factor to one implying the Canadian dollar-U.S. dollar exchange rate is a random walk dominated by permanent cross-country monetary and productivity shocks."

      "Zahlreiche Studien zeigten, dass Eltern - und hier insbesondere Mütter - besonders häufig und in vielfältiger Weise bereits früh zu den Hauptleidtragenden der Pandemie gehörten. Auch zwei Jahre nach Ausbruch der Corona-Pandemie können wir dies anhand der vorliegenden Auswertungen der jüngsten Befragungsdaten aus dem Januar 2022 der HBS-Panel-Erwerbspersonenbefragung bestätigen. Mütter tragen weiterhin deutlich stärker die Hauptbetreuungslast als Väter und berichten zuletzt verstärkt wieder von Arbeitszeitreduktionen, die sich so bei Vätern nicht zeigen. Mütter äußern zudem in besonderem Ausmaß sozio-emotionale Belastungen und gesellschaftliche Sorgen, die zuletzt wieder anstiegen. Zudem scheint diese Situation auch erhebliche Auswirkungen auf die Zufriedenheit mit dem Krisenmanagement der Bundesregierung zu haben, da diese unter Müttern zuletzt nur noch sehr gering ausfällt. Detailliertere Analysen der Perspektiven auf die Pandemie unter Müttern zeigen darüber hinaus eine starke Polarisierung, die sicherlich auch z. T. die große Sorge unter Müttern über den gesellschaftlichen Zusammenhalt erklären kann. Zusammengenommen zeichnen die Befunde ein besorgniserregendes Bild großer Belastungen und politischen Vertrauensverlusts, die zudem mit Prozessen der Retraditionalisierung bei der Betreuungsübernahme einhergehen. Diese Folgen unzureichender politischer Berücksichtigung und Absicherung von Sorgearbeit in der Pandemie und der daraus folgenden weitreichenden Individualisierung der Sorgearbeit sollten politisch unbedingt ernst genommen werden."

      "The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic puts countries and their governments in an unprecedented situation. Strong countermeasures have been implemented in most places, but how much do people trust their governments in handling this crisis? Using data from a worldwide survey, conducted between March 20th and April 22nd, 2020, with more than 100,000 participants, we study people's perceptions of government reactions in 57 countries. We find that media freedom reduces government trust directly as well as indirectly via a more negative assessment of government reactions as either insufficient or too strict. Higher level of education is associated with higher government trust and lower tendency to judge government reactions as too extreme. We also find different predictors of perceived insufficient reactions vs. too-extreme reactions. In particular, number of COVID-19 deaths significantly predicts perceived insufficient reactions but is not related to perceived too-extreme reactions. Further survey evidence suggests that conspiracy theory believers tend to perceive government countermeasures as too strict."

      "Im Rahmen des ersten Lockdowns während der COVID-19 Pandemie wurde verstärkt gefordert, die weit fortgeschrittene internationale Arbeitsteilung wieder teilweise zurückzufahren und Produktion in Zukunft wieder zu re-regionalisieren bzw. wieder nach Österreich zu bringen. Während diese Forderungen vor dem Hintergrund einer zum Teil schwierigen Versorgungslage mit medizinischem Equipment in einer globalen Pandemie verständlich sind, sind sie jedoch ökonomisch nicht zielführend. Die vorliegende Policy Note zeigt, dass Österreich zu den Gewinnern sowohl der Globalisierung als auch der europäischen Integration der vergangenen 30 Jahre zählt. So sind die Pro-Kopf-Einkommen in Österreich gemäß aktuellen Untersuchungen durch die EU-Mitgliedschaft allein um mehr als acht Prozent größer. Auf Basis aktueller Daten zur internationalen Wirtschaftsverflechtung ist darüber hinaus beobachtbar, dass Österreich zentral in internationalen Wertschöpfungsketten verankert ist. Zwar spielt die inländische Nachfrage für Österreichs Wirtschaft eine wichtige Rolle, dennoch ist die Bedeutung ausländischer Nachfrage für Österreich ebenso entscheidend: Rund ein Drittel der gesamten österreichischen Wirtschaftsleistung wird durch ausländische Endnachfrage bestimmt. Auf Branchenebene besitzen aber einzelne Branchen weitaus höhere Quoten. Dies gilt vor allem für die Industrie (z.B. die Kraftfahrzeugherstellung oder Metallerzeugung) aber auch einige Dienstleistungsbranchen (z.B. der Großhandel, der Transport und die Finanzbranche). Aus diesen Ergebnissen ergeben sich weitreichende Implikationen für die Wirtschaftspolitik bei der Bekämpfung der durch die COVID-19 Pandemie ausgelösten Wirtschaftskrise und darüber hinaus. (...)"

      "Using data from more than 6,000 manufacturing firms in India for 1996–2008, we investigate the impact of financial constraints on the exporting behavior of Indian manufacturing firms while also focusing on the link between exchange rate movement and exports. We find that there is a strong degree of persistency in the exporting behavior of Indian manufacturing firms, reflecting the high fixed costs of entering foreign markets for Indian firms. A firm with a higher amount of net cash flows and smaller debt-to-asset ratios is more likely to become an exporter, indicating that a firm tends to self-finance its exporting without relying too much on external finances. Internal funds are especially important for firms that are not incumbent exporters to become exporters, and also for firms that do not enjoy technical advancement and high levels of productivity. When we divide the sample period into several subperiods, Indian firms have become less reliant on internal cash in recent years, but new exporters still rely on cash holdings to enter foreign markets. Over all, recent financial liberalization in India still does not allow the financial system to meet the stronger demand for funds by firms, especially small ones, though part of the stronger demand for funds are increasingly met by funds provided by foreign institutions. Based on our findings, improving the functionality of financial markets is an urgent issue to remove financial constraints that hinder Indian firms from entering export markets."

      "This paper examines how the implementation of a new dark order - Midpoint Extended Life Order on NASDAQ - impacts financial markets stability in terms of occurrences of mini-flash crashes in individual securities. We use high-frequency order book data and apply panel regression analysis to estimate the effect of M-ELO trading on market stability and liquidity provision. The results suggest a predominance of a speed bump effect of M-ELO rather than a darkness effect. We find that the introduction of M-ELO increases market stability by reducing the average number of mini-flash crashes, but its impact on market quality is mixed."

      "During the last two decades, the world has experienced a remarkable process of disinflation, with average inflation rates in industrialized countries falling by 10 percentage points and an even sharper decline of the mean rate of inflation in developing countries. Parallel to the decline in inflation rates, a tremendous increase in economic integration - often referred to as globalisation - has been taking place. In this paper, we analyse the effects of globalisation on inflation in OECD countries. We theoretically outline different channels through which globalisation may have influenced inflation dynamics and give an overview on the existing empirical evidence on this issue. In the empirical analysis we show that globalisation has contributed to the disinflation process in OECD countries since the 1980s. Inflation rates became much less prone to domestic parameters, especially the domestic output gap. Global factors such as the output gap of the main trading partners became more important in determining national inflation rates. Furthermore, economic freedom and the degree of globalisation are positively related to the disinflation process. Central bank independence seems to have contributed to the decline in inflation rates among OECD countries, but the effect is rather modest. Though the inertia of inflation can still be observed, the persistence of inflation has considerably declined since the early 1990s."

      "We introduce \"group cohesion\" to study the economic relevance of social relationships in team production. We operationalize measurement of group cohesion, adapting the \"oneness scale\" from psychology. A series of experiments, including a pre-registered replication, reveals strong positive associations between group cohesion and performance assessed in weak-link coordination games, with high-cohesion groups being very likely to achieve superior equilibria. In exploratory analysis, we identify beliefs rather than social preferences as the primary mechanism through which factors proxied by group cohesion influence group performance. Our evidence provides proof-of-concept for group cohesion as a useful tool for economic research and practice."

      "Recently, homeownership rates of migrants in Germany increased by more than 10 percentage points. To shed light on this sharp increase, this paper investigates the change in homeownership rates of immigrant households in Germany between 1996 to 2005 and 2000 to 2012 respectively using a probit-based non-linear decomposition method. Empirical findings suggest that 50 percent of the change in immigrant's homeownership rate within the first time period can be explained by characteristics, especially by age and educational attainment. In the second time period, the explanatory power of characteristics is almost zero indicating that it is the favorable economic environment during that time that is responsible for the increase in homeownership of immigrant households in Germany."

      "Die Bedeutung der Kundenkenntnis für den Markterfolg der Anbieter ist unbestritten. Dennoch wissen wir wenig darüber, wie gut die Anbieter ihre Kunden kennen. Dies gilt auch für den Handel. Deshalb befasst sich die hier vorgelegte Publikation mit der Ausprägung der Kundenkenntnis im Handel, aber auch mit den Quellen und Determinanten dieser Kenntnis und mit ihren Auswirkungen auf der Anbieter- und auf der Kundenseite. Beachtung finden alle möglichen Quellen der Kundenkenntnis, vor allem aber die Kundenkontakte. Im Einzelnen werden nicht nur relevante Theorien bemüht, sondern auch erste, differenzierte Forschungsergebnisse zur Ausprägung der Kundenkenntnis, zu den Einflussfaktoren und den Auswirkungen dieser Kenntnis präsentiert. Folgerungen für die künftige Forschung und für das Wissensmanagement im Handel schließen das Werk ab."

      "This paper replicates the estimates of a fractional response model for share data reported in the seminal paper of Leslie E. Papke and Jeffrey M. Wooldridge published in the Journal of Applied Econometrics 11(6), 1996, pp.619-632. We have been able to replicate all of the reported estimation results concerning the determinants of employee participation rates in 401(k) pension plans using the standard routines provided in Stata. As an alternative, we estimate a two-part model that is capable of coping with the excessive number of boundary values equalling one in the data. The estimated marginal effects are similar to those derived in the paper. A small-scale Monte Carlo simulation exercise suggests that the RESET tests proposed by Papke and Wooldridge in their robust form are useful for detecting neglected non-linearities in small samples."

      "Innovation activities in high tech industries provide considerable challenges for technology and innovation management. In particular, firms frequently face significant technological challenges since these industries has a long history of radical innovations which are taking place through distinct industry cycles of higher and lower demand. The paper investigates these issues for three high-tech industries, namely semiconductor manufacturing, biotechnology and electronic design automation which is a specific sub-segment of the semiconductor industry. It analyses the association of firm characteristics with different aspects of acquisition behaviour. Particular focus is put on innovation-related firm characteristics. The paper finds that the determinants for acquisitions are mostly related to firm size, financial conditions and geographical origin of the firm. Only for biotechnology, a substitutive relationship is identified between acquisitions and own research activities."

      "This paper reviews recent approaches to modeling the labour market and assesses their implications for inflation dynamics through both their effect on marginal cost and on price-setting behaviour. In a search and matching environment, we consider the following modeling setups: right-to-manage bargaining vs. efficient bargaining, wage stickiness in new and existing matches, interactions at the firm level between price and wage-setting, alternative forms of hiring frictions, search on-the-job and endogenous job separation. We find that most specifications imply too little real rigidity and, so, too volatile inflation. Models with wage stickiness and right-to-manage bargaining or with firm-specific labour emerge as the most promising candidates."

      "This study examines whether the agency problem regarding credit risk is a useful corporate governance mechanism for controlling credit risk. For this purpose, we estimate the impact of internal control and agency problems on credit risk in commercial banks in Vietnam from 2009 to 2018. First, in line with corporate governance theory, we find that the agency problem is a statistically significant variable in the model. This result expands the existing literature. Second, we show that internal control is a mechanism to resolve the conflict of interest between the principal and agent. The author especially emphasizes the unchanged correlation of each independent variable to the dependent variable during the merger and restructuring of Vietnamese commercial banks in 2015."

      "Relative wages have been remarkably rigid for the last two decades in Danish manufacturing despite large shifts in relative employment from unskilled labor towards skilled and educated labor. Assuming capital-skill complementarity and fixed relative wages as a consequence of labor market institutions, we argue that skill upgrading is more pronounced during downturns than upturns. This prediction is supported by a high positive and significant correlation between changes in relative employment of skilled labor and changes in the unemployment rate. Furthermore, we show that international outsourcing has played an important role in explaining the shift in relative labor demand."

      "The nature of learning processes as well as evolutionary considerations suggest that aesthetic judgement is of central importance in the formation of custom. Learning and extrapolation rely on evaluations of non-instrumental features like simplicity, analogy, straightforwardness, and clarity. Further, learning is particularly effective if it is driven by an active desire to uncover new regularities, rather than merely gathering information in a passive way.From an evolutionary perspective, learning has evolved as an adaptation to fast and transitory environmental changes which cannot be effectively traced by the slow and long-term evolutionary processes which take place on the genetic level. The evolutionary raison d'être of learning is to enable the individual to incessantly search for upcoming new regularities, and to act appropriately on them. As learning depends on aesthetic judgement, the evolutionary selection for learning implies an evolutionary molding of an aesthetic sense, and a preference for patterns and patterned action which ultimately leads to the formation of custom and social learning. The paper presents, thus, an evolutionary underpinning for the behavioral tendencies underlying my theory of custom."

      "The Internet roared to the scene in Latin America and it is transforming the way Latin Americans interact, shop, bank, and spend their time. The Internet is changing regional consumption patterns, the landscape of regional companies, and the region's economic prospects. Disruptive digital technologies riding on the web -cloud-based services, e-commerce, 3D printing, Internet of Things, and so on- are empowering LAC companies of all sizes to dramatically cut costs, improve customer service, and create brand new products and services. The region is also home to innovative digital companies run by intrepid entrepreneurs, some of whom have accessed significant investments from Silicon Valley and grown into some of the leading digital companies. The Internet, in short, has opened tremendous new opportunities for LAC economies to become more productive, expand opportunities for entrepreneurship, and drive inclusive economic growth."

      "'Guest workers' earn higher wages overseas on temporary low-skill employment visas. This wage effect can quantify global inefficiencies in the pure spatial allocation of labor between poorer and richer countries. But rigorous estimates are rare, complicated by migrant self-selection. This paper tests the effects of guest work on Indian applicants to a construction job in the United Arab Emirates, where a crisis exogenously influenced job placement. Guest work raised the return to labor by a factor of four, implying large spatial inefficiency. Short-term effects on households were modest. Effects on information, debt, and later migration were incompatible with systematic fraud."

      "The industrial organization approach to the microeconomics of banking augmented by uncertainty and risk aversion is used to examine credit derivatives and macro derivatives as instruments to hedge credit risk for a large com- mercial bank. In a partial-analytic framework we distinguish between the probability of default and the loss given default, model different forms of derivatives, and derive hedge rules and strong and weak separation properties between deposit and loan decisions on the one hand and hedging decisions on the other. We also suggest how bank-specific macro derivatives could be designed from common macro indices which serve as underlyings of recently introduced financial products.",

In einem partialanalytischen Ansatz unterscheiden wir die Wahrscheinlichkeit des Kreditausfalls und den Verlust bei Kreditausfall, modellieren in stilisierter Weise unterschiedliche Formen von Derivaten und leiten Hedge-Regeln und Separationsaussagen her. Zusätzlich unterbreiten wir einen Vorschlag, wie bankspezifische Makroderivate aus gängigen Makroindizes konstruiert werden können."

      "Dieser Beitrag behandelt den Einfluss von Leasing auf Bilanzkennziffern. Dabei steht eine Veränderung der Bilanzierung von Leasingverhältnissen nach IFRS im Vordergrund, durch die sich Leasing anders auf die Bilanz und entsprechend auf Bilanzkennziffern auswirkt als zuvor. Der Entwurf für diese neue Leasingbilanzierung wurde am 17.08.2010 vom IASB als Standardentwurf im Exposure Draft (ED) 2010/9 „Leases“ veröffentlicht. Dieser ist die Grundlage für einen angestrebten neuen Standard, der letztendlich den seit 1982 geltenden Standard IAS ablösen soll, der die bisher geltende Bilanzierung von Leasingverhältnissen regelt. Einer der wichtigsten Ansätze des ED/2010/9 „Leases“ ist die bilanzielle Erfassung aller Leasingverhältnisse, während bei der Bilanzierung nach IAS 17 nicht alle Leasingverhältnisse in der Bilanz berücksichtigt wurden. Die Ergebnisse stellen deutlich heraus, dass die Leasingbilanzierung nach ED/2010/9 einen signifikanten Einfluss auf entscheidungsrelevante Kennziffern haben kann. Die zum Teil enorme Verschlechterung der Rating- und Investorenkennziffern könnte für die betroffenen Unternehmen besonders dann problematisch werden, wenn die Leasingverbindlichkeiten von den Bilanzadressaten bisher nicht berücksichtigt wurden."

      "The estimation and analysis of the distribution of the negative health impacts of certain commodities subject to excise taxes in Belize and the distribution of the burdens of the excise taxes across households of different income levels are the focus of this article. Particular attention is given to the taxation of soft drinks and cosmetics. We examine the income distribution and tax revenue impacts using the commodity data from the household expenditure survey by and the effective tax rates expressed as a percentage of the value of the final consumption of each item. As in many developing countries, taxes on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products are found to be regressive. The most regressive excise taxes are on soft drinks and cosmetics. Households across the economy pay more in excise taxes on cosmetics than they do on either alcoholic beverages or tobacco products. Relative to the level of household expenditures, the burden of the excise taxes on cosmetics is highest for households in the lowest quintile of total expenditures. The impact of soft drinks in creating obesity is likely to be much greater for high income households whose total consumption per household is twice that of low-income households."

      "A sizeable literature analyses how immigration affects attitudes towards migrants and discusses differences between socio-economic groups and their potential correlation with perceived concerns about labour market competition. Against the background of the large-scale influx of refugees into Germany between 2015 and 2016, this paper uses data from a unique and representative survey of the German population to assess whether respondents express fears of job loss due to immigration. We focus on the importance of perceptions of migrants' ability to do one's job in relation to these fears. Moreover, we compare concerns about refugees with those about EU migrants. We propose several hypotheses regarding egotropic and sociotropic motives. Our findings indicate that: (i) Respondents are more likely to view EU migrants as potential competitors in the labour market. (ii) Workers in blue-collar occupations and without tertiary education are more likely to view migrants as potential competitors on the labour market. (iii) The perception of potential competition from migrants strongly predicts fear of job loss. Once we control for this perception, occupation and skill levels are no longer significantly related to the probability of reporting fear of job loss. Moreover, there are no longer significant differences between the two migrant groups. (iv) Anti-migrant sentiments are also associated with concerns about job loss."

      "This study explores the labour impact of four scenarios of electricity generation in Chile, including three coal power phase-down scenarios. These scenarios would result in the creation of between 32 and 40 thousand direct and indirect jobs and between US$1.7 and US$1.8 billion in value added in 2030, compared to present-day situation. Net numbers mask winners and losers. The most significative negative impact we find would be the progressive disappearance of 4 thousand jobs in coal power plants by 2030 or 2050 depending on the scenario. These impacts are not significant when compared to Chile’s labor markets and GDP. Chile’s economy routinely creates more than 40 thousand jobs per trimester, and US$1.7 billion is just 0.8% of GDP, while GDP is expected to grow at least 2.5% per year between today and 2030. At the national level, our results suggest that a careful planning and implementation of coal phase out could be able to mitigate its negative impacts, given that they will be small relative to the size of Chile’s economy. In practice, whether the jobs created nationally match the skills available in the geographical location of current coal power plants is likely to play a key role. This study does not investigate this issue, but a separate technical note studies affected communities with more details and provides lessons learned from historic management of the labor impacts of policy reforms."

      "In some studies, only financial aspects are emphasized, but we also see cases of assessing the financial health of municipalities through socio-economic indicators. Public organizations worldwide have had to increase their financial performance by adopting management practices. Nonetheless, financial performance might be mostly predicted by contingencies that are not within direct managerial control. The purpose of this paper is to identify clusters of municipalities on the basis of agglomerate cluster analysis, the results of which will point to the financial situation of the municipalities in the selected region. The main aim of this contribution is to identify the location of the municipalities of the chosen self-governing region of Slovakia using the clustering method by selected financial indicators. Individual clusters have similar properties and they differ from the characteristics of businesses in other clusters. The results show that organizational and environmental contingencies affect financial performance, but a significant amount of variation in financial performance is unexplained-indicating that management creates better financial health in the municipality and creates a clearer budget for the management, employees, and residents of the municipality."

      "The current global economic development faces social and environmental challenges, such as climate change and environmental pollution, which requires firms to be more socially responsible. Due to the fast-growing corporate social responsibility (CSR) consciousness and concerns of individual investors in the stock market, the newly listed firms are likely to face greater legitimacy pressure from stakeholders in China. This institutional environment is quite suitable to explore how public listing influences firms' CSR performance and its potential mechanism. Using a sample of Chinese IPO firms for the years 2012-2016 and a multiple regression model controlling firm fixed effect and time fixed effect, we find that there is a significant and sustained increase in CSR performance after IPO. Further analyses also show that this increase in CSR performance is more pronounced in heavily polluting industries, especially at firms that are covered by more securities analysts, and more media. Overall, these findings suggest that CSR can be served as an instrument to manage sustainable development risk for IPO firms to meet the social and environmental expectations of various stakeholders. By highlighting the prominent role that public listing plays in firms' CSR decisions, this study draws the regulator's attention to promoting sustainable economic development in other developing countries like China, which lack mature CSR culture and institutional environment."

      "Using several data sources from Chile, we study the impact of the size of the school choice set at the time of starting primary school. With that purpose, we exploit multiple cutoffs defining the minimum age at entry, which not only define when a student can start elementary school, but also the set of schools from which she/he can choose. Moreover, differences across municipalities in the composition of the schools according to these cutoffs allow us not only to account for municipality fixed factors (educational markets) but also for differences in the characteristics between schools choosing different deadlines. That is, we compare the difference in outcomes for children living in the same municipality around the different cutoffs with those for children in other municipalities that experience a different change in the available set of schools across cutoffs (double difference in RD). We show that a larger set of schools increases the probability of starting in a better school, measured by a non-high-stakes examination. Moreover, this quasi-experimental variation reveals an important reduction in the likelihood of dropping out and a reduction in the probability that a child would switch schools during her/his school life. Second, for a subsample of students who have completed high school, we observe that a larger school choice set at the start of primary school increases students' chances of taking the national examination required for higher education and the likelihood of being enrolled in college."
